  "text": "Dear Larbaud: Miss Monnier sent me a copy of the passage in your letter. Would it be possible to see this complete before publication—if it is for publication? Here is a kind of reply which I shall add to in about three or four days. Irlandais: In its widest sense this may mean (a) Citizens or subjects of Irish Free State (b) ” ” ” ” Northern Ireland (c) Irishborn or Irishdescended Americans (d) Irish in Great Britain and British Empire (excluding Ireland) (e) Irish in foreign countries (Irishborn or Irishdescended) (f) The dead Irish (‘all Livia’s daughtersons’) But I suppose you mean the average badaud of class (a). I think that by now he can probably read (when sober enough) ten street names. Having read sɼaid (sraid) so often he must know that it means street. (An American visitor to Paris might conclude that M. Barrée was the Washington of France from the number of streets named after him.) But unless he has been taught the few strange letters of the Irish alphabet (a (a) d (d) g (g) ɼ (r) t (t)) he cannot read ten letters with certitude: and unless he has been taught the Irish phonetic system he cannot pronounce them, except in single cases of words popularised by political events or folklore: and unless he has learnt Irish he cannot understand even if he reads and pronounces. The phonetic system is strange. Thus A) oidċe: English spelling = oidliche (B) ” pronunciation = eehya ” sense = night French pronunciation y (h) y’a Irish is written sometimes as (A) less often as (B). I shall answer your questions about Breton in a few days but I think Breton, though more spoken, has incorporated more Latin words (for an obvious reason) than Irish has. I think the Latin words in Irish are chiefly (1) ecclesiastical—the oldest (sagaɼt = priest-sacerdos: leaḃaɼ = book, liber) (2) administrative—Norman and Norman-English (post = post: seanad = senate) As for English words of Anglo-Saxon origin they should be rare. The Irish peasant had no need to change the word uiſge (ishgö) into ‘water’. And though Breton (when costumed and visited by tourists and blessed by Rome and caliné by S. Pseudonymous and Co) is probably more picturesque, of course Irish as a language is Will this do? Thanks for your wire about Molly’s hairpins. I mean her accents. I was operated on 11 June. No improvement.",
