  "text": "Dear MacAlmon [sic]: Thanks for your friendly letter. I hope you got mine with the I.O.U. Since that collapse I have knocked off about 10 hours a day, work 6 and go walking. I feel much better so. I send back your proof and the letter. Send on a few more stories, the ones the English printer boggled at. This one is all right but I’d like to see more. So is the letter. I hope it is published somewhere. By the way the proof has many misprints⁠[.] I didn’t correct them as I thought you might have sent me a second copy. Proof is very tricky. I sent on that lot of Penelope to Budgen but he hasn’t written yet about it. If you see him please ask him to send it back. I have now written in a great lot of balderdash all over the damn book and the first half is practically as it will appear. I shall give Molly another 2000 word spin, correct a few more episodes and write all over them and then begin to put the spectral penultimate Ithaca into shape. Meanwhile walking along the Seine I look for some secluded spot where I may ‘catch a hold of Bloom and throw him in the bloody sea’ (pron. ‘say’). How did you get on with Budgen and what news is there of Miss Weaver and others. Rodker is here but is going away again. I can take charge of that typewriter if you like but perhaps you want it or haven’t you a portable one? Miss Beach and Miss Monnier are in the south, so is Nutting. If you ever find anything relating to what I am doing throw it into an envelope and perhaps it will go into the stew. No more subscriptions for Ulysses. Only 4 or 5 last month. Whatever you send to France send by registered letter post (I mean your proofs, for example) as parcel post goes through the customs and takes a devil of a time. Kind regards and good luck Sincerely yours James Joyce",
