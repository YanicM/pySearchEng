  "text": "Dear Mrs Sax: We rang up your sister when we came back and found that she was not feeling too well physically so got her to see our physician Dr Fontaine who says there is nothing the matter with her except fatigue and gave her a tonic to take. She seems to have caught a summer cold. Anyhow my wife saw her yesterday and I am to tell you there is absolutely no need for you to worry. She hopes to begin her holiday next week. We may go to Berne then too but it is not sure. The case of wine has now come. Many thanks to Mr Sax but he is on no account to send me any more of anything. My wife is not here at present and I cannot make out your address on the picture postcard so I send this to Zâ€™ch. Thank heaven one of the summer months is almost over! I wish it would snow. Friendly greetings from us to you both sincerely yours James Joyce",
