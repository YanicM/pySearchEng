  "text": "Dear Stannie, I think we shall have to go to a hotel. I cannot get a room. They want 70 and 80 Lire a month for rooms, don’t want couples or children, don’t want to give the use of a kitchen. I went to agents put an advt in the paper, walked miles: no use. This city, I confess, beats me. If anyone asks you how I like how I like [sic] tell them I think it is the stupidest old whore of a town ever I was in. This country irks me beyond measure: perhaps I should say only this city. But the system of life must be the same everywhere. Of course, your prosy old friend H.J. and other respectables like to write about Italy and Italians and subtle Romans. I have seen a lot of Romans now and if anyone asks you what I think of them you may say that so far as I can see their chief preoccupation in life is the condition (to judge from their speech) broken, swollen etc of their coglioni and their chief pastime and joke the breaking of wind rereward. This kind of mechanical obscenity is damnably tiresome. However, it is an expletive which I am reserving for the day when I leave the eternal city as my farewell and adieu to it. If the word vulgar has any meaning I think the European palm must go to Italy. After all, Germany has something under her uniforms. An Italian carabiniere with his absurd high hat or a Papal Swiss might be the symbol of this tawdry civilisation. As for Rossini’s statement it is probably not quite accurate as he forgot Turkey and Portugal. But I am discontented with everything and everybody at present—no wonder. Aunt J writes a brief letter, half of which is about MacCormack’s voice and Caruso’s trial. I am afraid I shall have to give it up, the time is out of joint. ‘We done our best, the dear knows!’ I have discontinued reading the D.M. supplement. So long as there was mystery and money in it I read but now the love interest has begun. The last sentence I read in it ran ‘So he kissed away the tears and after that there was nothing more but the great glow of love—“I don’t even know your name, he whispered.”’ I am reading Life’s Little Ironies by Hardy. It is a late book of his. O.G., I understand, writes in Sinn Féin under the name of ‘Mettus Curtius’, the gent who leaped into the chasm in the forum, I think. Explain how it is that while Byrne and Pappie and Mrs Cosgrave formed a true opinion of O.G. I, with more opportunity, formed an untrue one. Send me an account of the last supper: it will amuse me even if I never write the story. Write to me also about Hunter. How can I do anything in my present condition? Last week I ‘worked’ 12 hours a day. This should be enough to satisfy even my dreamy Irish friends. How Starkey would laugh and how Roberts would giggle if they knew that after my day’s ‘wurruk’ I go and speak for two hours about the pen, the blackboard and inkstand for 9½d per hour! It is now Friday and I have not yet got a room! One of Hardy’s stories is about a man in 1804 who saw ‘Boney’ and an adjutant taking notes on the coast of Devon, I think. The story made me think of Meredith’s poem beginning ‘Cannon his voice’. I suppose it is because I never played football or was treated only slightly to your captain of fifty’s regime that I can’t turn out that kind of poetry. I suppose the hero’s valet is really his panegyrist poet. The other stories—wait now: here are the names ‘The Son’s Veto’ ‘A Case of Conscience’ ‘Two Ambitions’ ‘A Fiddler of Reels’ ‘The Melancholy Hussar’ ‘To Please his Wife’ ‘On the Western Circuit’ ‘A Tradition’. One or two are like the ‘Boney’ one. Others are about hard-working parson’s sons, one is about a marvellous country fiddler, and the rest are about ‘mésalliances’ (!). One story is about a lawyer on the circuit who seduces a servant, then receives letters from her so beautifully written that he decides to marry her. The letters are written by the servant’s mistress who is in love with the lawyer. After the marriage (servant is accompanied to London by mistress) husband says fondly ‘Now, dear J.K.-S-&C, will you write a little note to my dear sister, A.B X. etc and send her a piece of the wedding-cake. One of those nice little letters you know so well how to write, love’. Exit of servant wife. She goes out and sits at a table somewhere and, I suppose, writes something like this ‘Dear Mrs X— I enclose a piece of wedding-cake.’ Enter husband—lawyer, genial. Genially he says ‘Well, love, how have you written’ and then the whole discovery is found out. Servant-wife blows her nose in the letter and lawyer confronts the mistress. She confesses. Then they talk a page or so of copybook talk (as distinguished from servant’s ditto). She weeps but he is stern. Is this as near as T.H. can get to life, I wonder? O my poor fledglings, poor Corley, poor Ignatius Gallaher! (The banker is rather polite to me but I can’t help wondering why he is always running in and out of the room. I suppose he makes money on every run) What is wrong with these English writers is that they always keep beating about the bush. John Long answered my note today and asks me to send MS for his consideration at the same time asking who had accepted and then declined to publish the book. I wrote telling him and promising the MS in a few days. I wonder is there any chance of his taking it? What kind of ‘work’ does he bring out? I suppose he is no relative of the J.L. who kept the public-house at the corner of Duke Street and was a friend of our grandfather’s. I will send the MS as soon as I get settled. It is now Friday evg and I have found no room yet. The old Bethelemites must have been like these Italian bastards. I feel for poor old Joseph. Last night we were put out of our room. I had lessons from 7 to 10 after the bank. Nora was waiting for me for two hours first in a cinematograph and then in a restaurant. I ate a big dinner being very hungry and at half past eleven left the restaurant with the holy family. It was raining so to protect Nora’s hat and the child I got a car and we drove to a hotel some distance away where I had heard the tariff was moderate. It was full (at least, the porter said so) and we had to drive on further to another one. Here we found a room for the night. The evening cost me 9 Lire! Today I am again seeking a room. Address your letters meanwhile c/o Nast, Kolb & Schumacher, Rome. I send you S.F. with a column of O.G.’s stupid drivel. I see he has advanced from ‘le petty mere’ as far as ‘le bête noir’. This he learned I suppose from the stolidly one-languaged Sludge. What a pleasant time I am having. Jim",
