  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Incredible though it may seem I have a new eye attack threatening me. I seem exhausted but am working as much as I dare. You have my authorisation to make any arrangements you wish with Mr Mathews and Mr Richards. I wrote to the latter two or three years ago on the subject of Verbannte and enclose my contract (on which I paid 1000 frs Swiss) with Mr Rascher. Neither he nor any other publisher ever sends any royalties so that there is practically nothing for Mr Pinker to administer (the private edition of Ulysses being my own affair and risk) though he is nominally my agent and, if Mr Richards desires, the agreement can be made through him. I hope that it will be made without trouble and that nobody, except you, will write to me on that or any other subject. I am far too nervous from illness and overwork to attend to business of any kind. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
