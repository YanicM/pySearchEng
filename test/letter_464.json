  "text": "Dear Pound: I came here a few days ago but was so busy looking after luggage etc that I could not write. It is useless to go into the subject of my physical and financial collapse in August. As regards the former what is done is done. I cannot see very well even yet but the sight gets better. About the latter I owe you and Miss Weaver very much for your prompt kindness. But for you I should have been derelict. I notice that you blame yourself for having misled me. The stupidity, however, is at my end. I am glad Ulysses is to appear in both reviews from March on and now that I can read and write again I shall get to work. I hope you will both like it. I send you a copy of Marzocco with an article by Mr Diego Angeli. The Manager of Messrs Cres and Co spoke to me about a French translation of my novel (to be published in the course of the present century) and Dostoyevsky’s daughter was here yesterday. She has read Mr Angeli’s article and wants a copy of the book. She will have to print one for herself, I fear. My wife told me you are bringing out a book with an essay in it about the novel. It may interest therefore to hear that after the first edition had been sold out and the book reviewed in eight countries the printers wrote asking the writer to delete and alter passages in it and refused to print even the second edition. I believe Miss Weaver has found some printer in the country who will do it, he says, I am now correcting proofs of Exiles. Yeats wrote to me about it but he seems to have forgotten what it is about. In any case he says his theatre is passing through a crisis. The actors he has now cannot even play low comedy. In the hope that things may have improved I am writing to him again about [it] rather pressingly. I am also going to write to Mr Martyn though I do not know him. If their theatre has no actors to play it surely they could be trained. If not what are they doing on the stage? I shall write also to Mr Sturge Moore who, you said, liked it and to Mr Archer again and to Mr [word missing] and possibly to Mr Short, Mr Barker and Mr Symons. In fact, as usual, I shall write a great number of letters to a great number of people. I got copies of Little Review with your amusing and highspirited lines. The review looks more prosperous since you took over the European editorship. I hope Mrs Pound and yourself are quite well. This letter, tardy as it is, is not very long or even complete but sometimes I find it difficult to keep my eyes open—like the readers of my masterpieces. I have the impression that I am forgetting to tell you many things. No doubt I shall remember them five minutes after having posted this letter. I got Mr Eliot’s verses only this morning. Accept my very sincere thanks however lamely expressed, for having helped me at such a difficult moment. Yours very gratefully James Joyce",
