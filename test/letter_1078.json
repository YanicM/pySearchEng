  "text": "Dear Eliot: Isn’t this a nice letter. I have used your name in a letter my solicitors are sending. A copy of this will be sent you before it is dispatched. If you disapprove I will have the phrase deleted. I used yours and O’Casey’s, coupling them with my own, rather than G.B.S. or H.G.W. etc because we are more or less of an age and represent three clearly different branches of writing. I suppose I am letting myself in for another big bill for costs but here goes! Excuse me for not having rung up. I have been strangely unfit these last few days. What about the proofs and what has your sales manager done with my versicles? Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. What do you think I should ask for Japanese rights?",
