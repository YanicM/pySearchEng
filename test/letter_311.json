  "text": "Dear Roberts, I enclose copy of my solicitor’s letter to me which confirms what I have asserted all through our correspondence—the legal innocence of the passages you took exception to⁠[.] Nevertheless in order to end this interminable discord I have decided to close with your proposal of the other day, very reluctantly and entering my protest at the same time. That proposal was the omission of An Encounter from the book. I agree to that on the following conditions I believe that you will change your opinion very shortly after the publication of the book and believe also that its reception will strengthen your hand so far as to lead you to include the omitted story in subsequent editions Sincerely yours, [James Joyce]",
