  "text": "Dear Pound: Many thanks for yours of 26th ult. which arrived only this morning. Owing to the delay and the fact that I have nothing ready, I am sending you an accompanying note, as you wish. I sent three pieces of verse in December, I think, to Poetry (Chicago) through my agent, but heard nothing more of them. If they have not been and will not be published, would you take them in reversion? As regards stories I have none. I have some prose sketches, as I told you, but they are locked up in my desk in Trieste. As regards excerpts from Ulysses, the only thing I could send would be the Hamlet chapter, or part of it—which, however, would suffer by excision. If there is anything else I could do—perhaps a simple translation or review—will you tell me? I shall be glad to do it, though I am quite sure that, with your usual friendliness, you exaggerate the value of my poor signature as a ‘draw’. I have been thinking all day what I could do or write. Perhaps there is something if I could only think of it. Unfortunately, I have very little imagination. I am also a very bad critic. For instance, some time ago a person gave me a two-volume novel to read, Joseph Vance. I read it at intervals for some time, till I discovered that I had been reading the second volume instead of the first. And if I am a bad reader I am a most tiresome writer—to myself, at least. It exhausts me before I end it. I wonder if you will like the book I am writing? I am doing it, as Aristotle would say, by different means in different parts. Strange to say, in spite of my illness I have written enough lately. As regards my novel, it seems that it has now come to a standstill. I did not see any review in the New Statesman. Mr Boyd sent me a notice from the New York Sun, about 2,000 words, by Mr Huneker, very favourable. Miss Weaver sent me also other American notices but they seem to have fallen out of the envelope somewhere on the way. By the way, I think you ought to type your letters to me without cancellings of any kind. Perhaps that delayed your last letter. As I wrote you, the Stage Society wishes to reconsider my play, Exiles. I shall ask my agent to submit it also for publication in London and New York this autumn. I wish I could hear of a good dramatic agent in America who would take it up. Perhaps it would be more successful than A Portrait of the Artist. I send you a limerick thereon: There once was a lounger named Stephen Whose youth was most odd and uneven. He throve on the smell Of a horrible hell That a Hottentot wouldn’t believe in. In spite of the efforts of the critics of the Times and Manchester Guardian to galvanize the book into life, it has collapsed or is about to collapse—possibly for lack of inverted commas. I should like to hear what Yeats says about Exiles. I am rather tired for I have been correcting misprints in my novel. There are nearly four hundred. No revise was sent to me. This in view of a possible second edition during the century. The announcement on the last page of The Egoist is a pious exaggeration—so Miss Weaver writes. In any case I am better. Please write to me about your review. I shall go on writing, thanks to the kindness of my unknown friend and also of Mr Quinn. I hope you are well. My wife and noisy children thank you for your good wishes. From me, ogni bene!",
