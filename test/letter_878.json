  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: … I am working away at Yabc though the latest report about Mr Roth does not encourage me to carry out my plan of giving him the four watches [of Shaun] complete in exchange for a lump sum of dollars. He told Hemingway that he had used my name and pieces as a draw, that he had drawn 10,000 subscribers all over the States and that he did not think he wanted me any more as his readers (the 10,000) wanted amusing matter of a different kind. I should have an agent over there, I think…. Jo Davidson (the Russo-American sculptor who got Exiles put on in New York) is asking Miss Beach to persuade me to sit for him. Opfer (the Dane who did that drawing of Brandes and wanted to do me in oils) has started to do my son instead and an Irish sculptor Knox who saw Lucia performing at the Margaret Morris show wants to do a full figure of her. It never paints but it pours. My brother now writes he will be here at Easter whether on his honeymoon or not he does not say. In fact a great number of mountains are seeking out the prophet lately. He does not know what to make out of my ‘work in progress’ but ‘hopes for the best’. I suppose that Shane the Leslie has withdrawn a book Cantab, denounced by the bishop of Northampton. My eye is 1/1,000,000,000 better since I wrote last. I would like to cast it on the caricature of Exiles you mentioned. It has not come.",
