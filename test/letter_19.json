  "text": "I cannot cash your order today. I do not understand in the least what you write about Gaze’s. When you spend only three minutes at a letter it cannot be very intelligible. In any case Gaze’s was shut. My next meal therefore will be at 11 a.m. tomorrow (Monday): my last meal was 7 pm last (Saturday) night. So I have another fast of 40 hours—No, not a fast, for I have eaten a pennyworth of dry bread. My second last meal was 20 hours before my last. 20 and 40 = 60—Two meals in 60 hours is not bad, I think. As my lenten regulations have made me somewhat weak I shall go up to my room and sit there till it is time to go to bed. Your order will last me till Tuesday morning, as I shall be very hungry tomorrow. Douce has already paid me—how else did you think I was living so the only money coming to me here is 5 francs from my new pupil, Auvergniot. Jim",
