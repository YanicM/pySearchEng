  "text": "Dear Mr Brody: Thanks for your card and Goyertâ€™s address. Some time ago he sent me a work in German about Ulysses which you may wish to see. I shall send it on and shall be glad if you will return it when you have looked at it. As regards F.W. (no longer W.i.P.) I have just received some leaflets and send you one. In my opinion the price is altogether too high but it does not depend on me. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
