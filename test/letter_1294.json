  "text": "Allegretto Dear complimentary but most suspicious daughter-in-law. The reason I write in Italian to Giorgio is not to conceal anything from your keen swift flashing and infallible eye but because when he was introduced to me 30 years ago by Dr Giliberto Sinigaglia I said: Toh! Giorgio! To which he replied: Baaaa Boooo. Our conversation has continued in that tongue. But it is very nice indeed of you to say I may have that lovely big motor car with a door for every day in the week I would also like a pleasure yacht with a steamstack for every month in the year. We are indeed glad to read that you hope to come here. My wife has made 50 pots of jam, tell Stevie, i.e. plum, raspberry and, of course, greengage. Flats are all over the place. Mrs Jolas has taken a huge 25 room house in Neuilly. Prices are going down steadily. colla voce May the 17 devils take Muscoloni and the Alibiscindians! Why donâ€™t they make Pound commander-in-chief for Bagonghi and elect me Negus of Amblyopia? The Normandie just got in and turned about so that it leaves me little time to write. If and when you decide to cross and you want anything done here cable me. I am buying a fez and a chibouk. During the 1001 nights of the Imbecidrivelling war you will charm my ears with your tales of your adventures. In turns shall you narrate them and by turns I shall hear, with my feet of accomplishment on the cushion of comfort and the puffer of perplexity in the oracle of stupefaction.",
