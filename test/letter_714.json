  "text": "Dear Simson, Your letter was forwarded to me and we are both very sorry to have missed you. Unfortunately the condition of my eyes has been aggravated during the journey and at the moment I do not know whether I must remain in London to be operated (which I dread) or go on to the South of England or return to Paris. I am in fact waiting for a reply from my Paris doctor as the men I saw here were very pessimistic. In these circumstances I don’t know what can be done about your suggestion of including me in your forthcoming Book of Portraits of Writers. The only thing I can suggest for the moment is that you call on my publishers in Paris 12, Rue de l’Odeon and ask for a bundle of all the sketches and photographs which were made about the time of the publication of Ulysses. Even if I go back to Paris, to put myself again in my Doctor’s care, I don’t think that I could possibly pose for you. In any case will you please drop me a line and if you call on my publishers, might I ask you to tell Miss Moschos of the state of things, but add that no allusion should be made to the urgency of an operation in any letter addressed to me as I have not informed my wife of the gravity of the case. It would be a pleasure for me to meet you again after 20 years, and perhaps if all goes well I may be back in Paris cured. In the meantime, many thanks for your kind expression concerning my books. Sincerely yours, James Joyce",
