Can you send me the pages corresponding to these instalments? If Mr Pinker has it you need not send it. If he has the published version I must have these deleted passages typed at once and sent to him as part of the novel which he is submitting to Martin Seeker and Co for publication. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
