  "text": "Dear Larbaud: Herewith the explanation. Both your versions of ‘rognons etc’ are much better. I have asked Miss M. to get you Ruggieri’s catalogue. She says you can keep Circe till the rest of the book is sent which will be as soon as possible. She is going to have it printed in Chartres near which her people live so as to be in closer touch with the printer. I think we shall go to Denmark next week but you can always write here if you are in doubt as I shall leave my address. We went to Chartres the other day in Miss B’s car i.e. my wife Miss B Miss M and I. I think I came with flying colours through some keen cross-examination by looking more like an idiot than usual. I saw S.G. once or twice and he has written an article on my ‘Work in Progress’ but A.M. I have not seen for 6 or 7 months, I think, 5 certainly. I hope your health is good now. My wife says about three times a week, I must reply to that letter in the morning. What will she think of me! etc. She writes about four letters a year preceded each by 3 months of good resolutions. So there you are! I hope we will soon have dinner all together under the patronage of S. Muscadet de Nantes. Una stretta di mano James Joyce",
