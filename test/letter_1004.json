  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Mr Edouard Dujardin is sending you from Paris a copy of his book Les Lauriers Sont Coupés which, he thinks, might be translated into English. He was a friend of Huysmans, Zola, Manet and of Mr George Moore. First published nearly 40 years ago it went into a second edition in 1924. It has a curious history—told in a preface by Mr Valery Larbaud—with which my name is associated. I hope you may find a London publisher for it. But for the reason above mentioned Mr Dujardin does not wish that it be issued by any publisher who publishes books of mine, either here or in America. This will be my address (or Euston Hotel, London, after 1 September) for the next two months, I expect, as I am taking a holiday and a rest. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Dujardin’s address is 3 rue Notre Dame des Champs, Paris VII",
