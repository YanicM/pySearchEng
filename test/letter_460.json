  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Many thanks for yours of 15. I hope you will soon settle the agreement with Mr Richards. On advice of my doctors I am trying to leave Zurich and pass the winter in Italian Switzerland. My health in the last days has taken a turn for the worseâ€”due, I believe, to this wretched climate. May I ask you therefore to write express to Mr Huebsch and request of him, in view of the present exceptional circumstances, to make me through you a remittance of royalties on my books or an advance on same, pending settlement of accounts. I shall write him also as the matter is urgent and I wish to leave on 15 Sept. or 1 October if I can Sincerely yours James Joyce",
