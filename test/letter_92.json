  "text": "Dear Stannie Before this you will have got my letter and my story ‘The Boarding-House’. I am awaiting your reply as well as your criticism on my novel and story. I send you tomorrow the 6th story ‘Counterparts’. You are to make a copy of it at once and return it to me on the same day if possible, recommending it in the post. I have written to Heinemann offering my verses. I continue my letter to you which I expect will cross your reply to mine. You see I am writing to you fully as you wish me to do. What is hidden under ‘Do not work too hard!’ Is it in good faith. I think I am rather preoccupied just now. Jim",
