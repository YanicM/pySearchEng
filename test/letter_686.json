  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I think everything is going right now. The printer has done more in the past three days than in the fortnight before. Since Saturday there has been endless confusion about the non-arrival and mistranslation of the passages to be read tomorrow night. However with the aid of two typists, Mr Larbaud, Mr Fargue and myself have at last set everything right. Mr Larbaud, it seems, went to bed at 7 this morning having finished his part. There never was such a tiresome book, I am sure. As regards Ithaca the question of printer’s errors is not the chief point. The episode should be read by some person who is a physicist, mathematician and astronomer and a number of other things. I hope to find one however. I think it better not to send you the extracts from it but if you prefer I can forward them. Penelope in printed proof (the 4th) is so illegible with interlineations that it would be useless to send it. In any case Ithaca should be read first…. I shall write to you again on Thursday after the séance about it and other things.",
