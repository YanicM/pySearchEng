  "text": "My dear Nora I found myself sighing deeply tonight as I walked along and I thought of an old song written three hundred years ago by the English King Henry VIIIâ€”a brutal and lustful king. The song is so sweet and fresh and seems to have come from such a simple grieving heart that I send it to you, hoping it may please you. It is strange from what muddy pools the angels call forth a spirit of beauty. The words express very delicately and musically the vague and tired loneliness which I feel. It is a song written for the lute. Jim Ah, the sighs that come from my heart They grieve me passing sore! Sith I must from my love depart Farewell, my joy, for evermore. I was wont her to behold And clasp in armes twain. And now with sighes manifold Farewell my joy and welcome pain! Ah methinks that could I yet (As would to God I might!) There would no joy compare with it Unto my heart to make it light.",
