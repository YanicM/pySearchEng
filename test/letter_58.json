  "text": "Dear Mr Russell Since I saw you last I have received a telegram asking me to go to Switzerland by the end of the week. I am, as you may imagine, very much pressed for money. I am sure that if you can you will assist me. I gave Mr Norman my third story ‘After the Race’ today and I think he will pay me for it tomorrow. But the mere fare to Switzerland is a considerable thing and this is why I have again to ask you to help me. Faithfully Yours Jas A Joyce",
