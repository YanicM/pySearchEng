  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver I shall feel obliged if you will write to me at above address to let me know if the last instalments of my novel have now been published in your review and also whether the type of these instalments, from the first, has been kept up. You were kind enough to say that you would reserve two copies of each issue from the date when I ceased to receive them. A letter sent to me as above will reach me after some delay, though, of course, I am still living at my old address and am unmolested. I hope that your review still comes out in spite of the bad times. With many kind regards and thanks Sincerely yours James Joyce",
