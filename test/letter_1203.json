  "text": "Dear Curran: In the hurry of leaving Paris I locked up your daughter’s letter so that I cannot reply to it. She said you might be passing through Paris. I am writing to excuse myself to her and also to you and also to tell you that I have taken a new flat there: 7 rue Edmond Valentin, VIIe tel: Invalides 50.38. Please let me know about what date you may be in Paris as I should very much like to meet you. I have to thank your daughter also for sending me some shamrock last March and you for the present of your essay on S. Laurence O’Toole and the two plays by Denis Johnstone. I was puzzled some time ago when I saw in the Irish Times a notice of one of these The Old Lady Says No for the name of the writer was changed. In return I should like to send you a copy of the edition de luxe of a fourth fragment from my book which came out in Holland. It has a cover design by my daughter and also an initial and a tail piece by her and is signed. Shall I have it sent to your Dublin address or c/o one of my Paris publishers or, if they be out of town, c/o my lawyer M. Paul Léon? My wife is making a cure here and we may go for a week or so to Luxembourg. You probably know this picturesque and old-fashioned Spa, mother of so many juvenile daughters. Unfortunately, we are in the midst of a rain wave. I am glad you got over your operation though I could not make out what it was for. My son Giorgio and his family are spending the summer at Long Beach, near New York. My daughter Lucia as you probably know, had some kind of a nervous breakdown but she is well on the road to recovery, I think. She also did an exquisite series of illuminated alphabet letters for Chaucer’s A.B.C., and Louis Gillet wrote a preface for it. I made arrangements through the Albatross Press manager for this to be brought out by Burns and Oates. They were so slow that I accepted an offer from the Servire Press of The Hague.",
