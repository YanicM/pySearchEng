  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: Can you let me know whether your kind offer of the villa for August is still open and, if so, the exact dates of your leaving and return. I delayed writing till now as I never know what is going to occur. If words are not complete in this epistle blame the ink not the drink. I am writing in a blaze of sunshine tempered by a pitch black room. And à propos of handwriting can you put me in touch with Mr Pulver and what does he charge for an opinion? I have something I feel inclined to submit to him. Friendly regards to Mr Giedion and yourself sincerely yours James Joyce",
