  "text": "Dear Sir: If you hold the dramatic rights of Riders to the Sea will you kindly let me know whether Mr Alfredo Sainati, manager of the Italian Grand Guignol Company can produce my translation of it in Italy and in what conditions. There is no idea for the moment of the translation being published. Messrs Maunsel of Dublin gave me to understand that they had the rights of the play and were making new arrangements with regard to it. Mr Sainati would be glad to know definitely whether he can have it produced or not and in the meantime is holding over the translation.",
