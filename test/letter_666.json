  "text": "Dear McAlmon: This is our new address into which we moved a day or two ago with much noise and bustle of boxes trunks MSS etc. Penelope is finished and at the printers. As it is to be done before the others for Larbaud I could send it on if this is still your address. Am working now putting Ithaca in order. No news here of any importance. I am afraid I am to blame for holding up your story. The French printers are boggled by all the w’s and k’s in our tongue and can do only about 100 pp at a time. However I swear I am doing my best to push Bloom on to the stage of the world by the beginning of November and then I suppose you have some kind of a chance. Meantime I wish you luck with that magnolious female.",
