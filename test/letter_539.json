  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I sent you a telegram from Milan on my way here with this new (temporary) address. My former address here will not find me. The roof and upper stories were destroyed by bombs shortly after my departure and last year my flat was cleared out and the contents (whatever remained after requisitioning on the part of the authorities and … requisitioning on the part of uninvited visitors) placed in storage. As it is almost impossible to find a flat I do not know how long I shall be at this, my brother’s, address where, however, you can address correspondence. The situation in fact is extremely discouraging and but for your help to me it would be disastrous. A few days before I left I forwarded to Mr Pound the episode of the Cyclops but I suppose there are many mistakes as I had not time to revise the typescript carefully. I should be glad to receive a copy of the article by Mr Quinn to which you allude in your last letter and also two copies of my novel which I should like to present to two friends of mine here, count Francesco Sordina and baron Ambrogio Ralli who very kindly obtained a safeconduct for me four years ago. I have heard nothing more of the projected French, Italian or Polish translation of that book. An offer for a German translation was made to me, definite, but I should not like to conclude anything unless I knew or trusted the translator. I think I am forgetting to write about many things but I have been and am so overloaded with extremely tiresome business of all kinds for the last three weeks that I cannot remember. If there is anything which I am neglecting will you please remind me. With many apologies for this jaded and confused letter and with kindest regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
