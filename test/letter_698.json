  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: A few lines in haste to acknowledge receipt of Exiles second edition. Will you please send a copy to: Mr Richard Wallace, rue Vaneau 52, Paris? Did a copy of this go to the Swedish publisher of the novel? I think copies of The Observer should go to Messrs Quinn, Linati and Benco marked with red pencil. The day after the article appeared 145 letters came asking for prospectuses. There is supposed to be an article today in the Daily Herald with a sketch which somebody did, unknown to me, while I was meditatively whistling bits of Tristan and Isolde. Please thank Miss Marsden for her message of congratulation. I have not been able to rest yet as I help in (or interfere with?) the packing and checking and sometimes address envelopes in a child’s handwriting and carry volumes to the post. I cannot rest till the edition is really off and the other press copies sent. This will take a few weeks more. Swiss reviews and critics are of no importance so that I don’t think you ought to inconvenience yourself about that Semaine Littéraire unless the copies were paid for…. It is very irritating waiting for reviews. I suppose it is because the book is so long. In a second edition the mistakes must be corrected. Some of the blunders and omissions which disfigure Ithaca especially are lamentable.",
