  "text": "It is half past six in the morning and I am writing in the cold. I have hardly slept all night. Is Georgie my son? The first night I slept with you in Zurich was October 11th and he was born July 27th. That is nine months and 16 days. I remember that there was very little blood that night…. Tell me. When you were in that field near the Dodder (on the nights when I was not there) with that other (a ‘friend’ of mine) were you lying down when you kissed? Did you place your hand on him as you did on me in the dark and did you say to him as you did to me ‘What is it, dear?’ One day I went up and down the streets of Dublin hearing nothing but those words, saying them over and over again to myself and standing still to hear better the voice of my love. What is to become of my love, now? How am I to drive away the face which will come now between our lips? Every second night along the same streets! I have been a fool. I thought that all the time you gave yourself only to me and you were dividing your body between me and another. In Dublin here the rumour here is circulated that I have taken the leavings of others. Perhaps they laugh when they see me parading ‘my’ son in the streets. O Nora! Nora! Nora! I am speaking now to the girl I loved, who had red-brown hair and sauntered over to me and took me so easily into her arms and made me a man. I will leave for Trieste as soon as Stannie sends me the money, and then we can arrange what is best to do. . O, Nora, is there any hope yet of my happiness? Or is my life to be broken? They say here that I am in consumption. If I could forget my books and my children and forget that the girl I loved was false to me and remember her only as I saw her with the eyes of my boyish love I would go out of life content. How old and miserable I feel! Jim",
