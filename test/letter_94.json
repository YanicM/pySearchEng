Do not send ‘Hallow Eve’ to any paper as I have sent it to ‘Literary World’ which offers prize of £10.10.0. Send me at once copies of this paper. Am awaiting story and remarks upon it. You are to show chapters to Curran and Cosgrave as before. What of The Holy Office? I shall continue correspondence on receipt of your next. Nora thanks Aunt Josephine for her kind letter. Jim",
