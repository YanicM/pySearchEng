I have however to submit my contribution as soon as possible and the payment is very high (£2–2–0 per 1000 words or twice the pay of the ‘Academy’) I have seen the editor of the ‘Academy’ too and have left my article with him and he is to tell me whether he thinks I will suit his paper. I cannot see Mr Tuohy till late tonight. Be sure to push on the ‘Irish Times’ and to let me know how the matter is going and also what exactly O’Hara said. I have written also to Courtney and expect letters from him and from Archer (if he is in London) in the morning. Jim",
