  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker I have just received your letter of 5 inst which crossed one I sent you two days ago. I hope Messrs Seeker will take on the novel. I am sending you a few notices of Dubliners which may possibly be of some use to you. I brought with me from Trieste the MS of Exiles. I shall now have it typed and sent on. My friend Mr Ezra Pound (5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington) writes me today that he has a promise from the manager of an American company about reading it. You could perhaps see him. I have a few verses by me—one or two—and would send them if you approve. Since I wrote Chamber Music (1907) I published verses only once—in the Saturday Review which printed some of my verses in the past. I mention this rather against my will as I prefer to have one thing done at a time: and the novel and the play are more important. But I must confess that I have now other motives. Mr Mencken of The Smart Set wrote also asking for contributions. In any case perhaps you will advise me on the matter. Sincerely yours James Joyce PS. Please note my new address where I shall probably remain for some time.",
