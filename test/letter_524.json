  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I enclose a letter from Mr Richards which explains itself. My relations with his firm have not been profitable either to him or to me and my contract with him has expired. As regards my book Ulysses it will not be finished, I suppose, for a year or so and when it is finished (if it is finished) I do not believe that Mr Richards or any of his colleagues in the United Kingdom will publish it or even find printers to print it. Some personal worries have also retarded its progress—to the relief of the few readers who honour it with their attention. My New York publisher, who has given me proof of a very friendly and energetic disposition, sails for England, he writes. Perhaps he is already there. He intends to call on you with regard to an eventual publication of the book—to be printed, possibly, in Africa. I forwarded some time ago the chapter Wandering Rocks to Mr Pound but it was not acknowledged. Was your copy of the typescript forwarded to you? I also sent to him in France the episode of the Sirens. This, at least, reached him and he told me he had sent it on to you and to Miss Anderson. I fear he does not like the book. I shall send the episode of the Cyclops next—but when I cannot say. If any further excerpts from the book have appeared in The Egoist I should like to see them. If it should be decided to publish Ulysses in the distant future I should like to propose (as I did repeatedly to Mr Richards) that it be published in paper covers at a price equivalent to that current in France. I have seen English novels offered here in the shop windows at 11 and 12 francs beside French novels offered at 3.80 or 4 francs. I may leave this country soon so that I shall be glad to hear from you on these matters. If you foresee only difficulties in the matter of publication I beg you to let no other considerations interfere with your own interests already too fruitlessly abused by me.",
