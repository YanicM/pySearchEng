  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I don’t know whether this letter will be very legible. This morning in the street I found my sight very hazy. I made the mistake of correcting proofs for about 6 hours the other day, as I did not want to be always victimising the Jolases. Minor matters first. I cannot or rather Léon [cannot] collect a penny from the Dutch publisher who owes Lucia and myself 40,000 frs and in addition to that my American publisher seems to owe me royalties on 10,000 or 15,000 copies which he is not inclined to send over. As to the illustrations made for the U.S. edition of Ulysses they are yours for ever and ever. Amen. If they had been signed L.J. instead of H.M. people would have had a different tale to tell. I am only too painfully aware that Lucia has no future but that does not prevent me from seeing the difference between what is beautiful and shapely and what is ugly and shapeless. As usual I am in a minority of one. If I tell people that no tenor voice like Sullivan’s has been heard in this world for 50 years or that Zaporoyetz, the Russian basso, makes Chialiapin sound like a cheap whistle or that nobody has ever written English prose that can be compared with that of a tiresome footling little Anglican parson who afterwards became a prince of the only true church they listen in silence. These names mean nothing to them. And when I have stumbled out of the room no doubt they tap their foreheads and sigh. And speaking about the bass voice in general and my son in particular he went over to America, we were told, for four months. He has been there now a year. He is at present on crutches. He sang twice over the radio to the natives who love poor old Ireland and insist that, if he is to please them, he must forget all about the unmusical countries of Europe and croon to them about Mother Machree and A Little Bit of Heaven. He has earned in all 35$. This amount he could have got in any southern French town for one performance before an audience which, however redolent of garlic, unlike the halfcastes in Covent Garden and the Metropolitan really does know the difference between a B and a bull’s foot. I have sent him over tons of music. No use. They insist that he is from Erin’s green isle and must sing that classical aria Blatherskite. I am writing this letter because Léon tells me you were kind enough to ring him up last night for news of me. I sleep like a log, eat like a hog and people say I have une mine superbe. But if they could see inside the watch they would use other words. I feel like an animal which has received four thunderous mallet strokes on the top of his skull. Yet in my letters to both my children and my daughter-in-law I keep up a tone of almost gay responsibility. As for Lucia it is not clear to me at all from your letter whether you liked her or not. And that is the only thing that matters. She did not go over to live on you as a parasite and please do not imagine that because members of my family bear my name or have some facial or vocal resemblance to me (I am not speaking of Giorgio and Lucia, of course) that there is much kinship. Non, merci! When I was in London in 1931 I offered my imbecile brother’s idiot son a weekly salary to help me with my notes to let him know what the book is about (by the way, what is it about?) I gave him a copy of the book of essays commonly called An Exag. His beautiful puresouled Irish stepmother, from whose face a negro would run away in terror, threw the book in the fire and forbade him to visit me. Not one line did any of them send us after Lucia’s visit to them. My cousin whom she also visited was over here judging cats did not think it worth her while to ring us up or to call on us. Possibly this giddy Dame is wroth with me on account of my very frigid response to her declarations of affection (utterly insincere, of course) in a taxicab here last year. She forgets or has not learnt that in this vile city wine, woman and wit are freely traded in the marketplace. Since Lucia’s arrival in Ireland, apart from telegrams asking for money, we have received no news at all from my sister except a few lines sent from a hotel. Her daughters who according to Budgen are film beauty types have now taken to the pen and then there were voluminous letters from my friend Curran addressed however not to me but to my wife, the long-suffering mother, the wife of this renegade. These were not answered as my wife has made a vow to write only one letter every seventh year. But as they contained a proposal to bring Lucia to a medical gentleman who has studied psycho-analysis in the United States, I at once cabled calling that off. After a good deal of talking I induced my wife to write to Lucia so that letters which now arrive are addressed to us both. This is a slight advance. But while I am glad in a way that Lucia is out of the dangers of Paris and especially of London every ring of the doorbell gives me an electric shock as I never know what the postman or telegraph boy is going to bring in. And if it is bad news all the blame will fall on me. Perhaps I was too hasty in thinking you meant to throw doubt on Lucia’s word. I am again in a minority of one in my opinion as everybody else apparently thinks she is crazy. She behaves like a fool very often but her mind is as clear and as unsparing as the lightning. She is a fantastic being speaking a curious abbreviated language of her own. I understand it or most of it. Before she went to London she spoke to me about you and what you had done for me. She wanted through herself to establish a final link between the dissolute being who is writing these lines and your honourable self. Then she went on to Ireland with the same idea. Whatever she may have succeeded in doing with you she will do nothing over there. How well I know the eyes with which she will be regarded! Léon is concerned for what she may do to prejudice my name there. And my wife who personally is probably worth both of her children rolled together and multiplied by three thinks that this is the chief reason for my constant state of alarm. So far as I can know myself it is not so. So long as she was within reach I always felt I could control her—and myself. And in fact I could. But now though I have the faithful support of my wife and Léon’s loyal friendship and that of some others here to say nothing of your own patience and sympathy there are moments and hours when I have nothing in my heart but rage and despair, a blind man’s rage and despair. I cannot be such an utter fool as to be inventing all this. But I can no longer control matters. On many sides I hear that I am and have been an evil influence on my children. But what are they doing away from that evil influence? On the other hand what can I honestly ask them to come back to? Paris is like myself a haughty ruin or if you like a decayed reveller. And any time I turn on the radio I hear some British politician mumbling inanities or his German cousin shouting and yelling like a madman. Perhaps Ireland and the U.S. are the safe places. And perhaps this is where the gas is really going to be turned on. Well, so be it. The motto under my coat of arms, however, is: Mors aut honorabilis vita. And in addition to all this my son’s Yankee Doodle doctor wants him to undergo an operation on the throat. And Mr John Allen that intrepid publisher who started to print Ulysses last October is still at work on the title page of that work. Here there comes the girl with two letters one from Mr Bailly whose wife has also gone to Bray and the other from Lucia which I hesitate to open. So I shall arise and take them both down to Léon, if I can find a cab, that is to say, because this is a socialist holiday. However some descendant of Peter the Great may be prowling around, marauding. If there is anything in Lucia’s letter I shall add a postscript. My eyes are trebly fatigued by now as the writing of this epistle was punctuated with lachrymal stops. What I would like to know if you are writing to me is whether you liked Lucia or not. She said she was sending me a letter she had from you but of course, scatterbrain forgot to put it in. She may be mad, of course, as all the doctors say but I do not like you to mention her in the same breath with my cousin or sister or anybody else. If she should be so mentioned then it is I who am mad. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
