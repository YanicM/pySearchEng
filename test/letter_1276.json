  "text": "Dear Helen: Just to say I hope you are having a pleasant time and that Stevie is enjoying his holidays. And also that things in general may have taken a turn for the better. There’s no news beyond that in my letter to Giorgio. Everybody just sitting around or walking about or lying down. As Lucia once remarked at dinner in a restaurant: Strange to think we are all sitting down and in a few hours we shall all be lying down. I should like to know who keeps order in the servants room. A redskin? From the 30th we shall have not even the one we have as she is going on holiday to set us a good example. A pair of shoes has just arrived and is being trained up and down the corridor. And my canaries are now cocoas. I had them dyed in response to general request. I am sending some printed matter but will allow it to speak for itself. With best wishes and hopes that the change and rest may benefit your father’s health. Babbo",
