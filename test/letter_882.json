  "text": "Dear Miss Bollach: The phrase in my MS reads ‘by that noblest of magistrates at his Saxon tannery with motto O’Neill etc’. You are right about ‘my face’ and ‘too’ One more change. In the speech that precedes the verse (Yc near end) for ‘Magrath or MacManagh’ read O’Bejorumsen or Mockmacmahonson’ Do you think you could leave part of it say Yab on Monday with your concierge so that I could be revising it in the meantime? You are having a terrible time with my MS, I am afraid. I am sorry to be the guilty cause and hope for your own sake it will soon be over. Many thanks in any case. A copy of Ulysses, 1st edition, ordinary paper autographed was lot 203 at a book auction in the Salle Drouot yesterday. It was sold for 2750 francs. My American price would be higher. I hope you have yours. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
