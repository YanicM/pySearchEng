  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: Thanks for your birthday cable and all messages. Tired after our arrival we could not do as much as usual. At 3 p.m. Gilbert gave a lecture on me at the Sorbonne for the Brit. Institute, with the 2 discs. Nora, Lucia and Eileen were there and they say it went very well. I got cables from Hiler, Cohn, Prince Noridett, Prof Fleiner (rector Z’ch University) Gideons [sic], Miss Weaver, Bridges, Ruggieri. Neither Miss Beach nor Miss Monnier sent anything, though the former was at the lecture well to the fore. In the evening we all had dinner at Fouquet’s with the Jolases, Gilberts and the Léons. I felt very lonely without you both but at least this time Lucia was there. Everyone found her much better. Don’t worry about the blood anomaly in her case. Naeggeli says it will recede of itself. It is most unusual but neither dangerous nor symptomatic. Eileen is staying here for a few weeks and the two get on very well. Miss Weaver has invited Lucia to London and perhaps she may travel back with Eileen. She may also go for a holiday to Ireland in the Spring. The great danger is past anyway but the doctors had nothing to do with that…. They could make nothing of her case except to tell me it was terribly funny as McGreevy would say though Lord knows how I did it. I used to act in charade with Digges in Dublin. The Skeffington [Mrs Skeffington], however, is wrong in alluding to me by my Christian name. The only person who ever addressed me so (of my companions or friends) was my poor friend George Clancy (Davin in the Portrait). This is carefully pointed out in the book. He was afterward Mayor of Limerick and was dragged out of bed by the Black and Tans in the night and shot in the presence of his wife. Now about Giorgio. The Irish in America probably know much more about the hindquarters of a hunter than they do about the thorax of a singer. Have you no influential Irish musical friends, people anyway who know that Brahms is a composer and not a breakfast food. Sullivan said Giorgio should start out in bass roles in the French provinces and so get experience and get over his Lampenfieber. Also if he did break down no harm was done. Denis MacSwiney (I spent two whole evenings with him) … thought he [Sullivan] was right in this. He said that American audiences have no standard of their own and can only countersign European verdicts. Don’t take this as advice. One has to be guided by events. Any beginning is better than no beginning. The ‘mike’ is not the footlights, it is true, but it is an opening, in fact, a great opening. One good effect it must have, viz, Giorgio will have to attend to his ways. I am indeed sorry to hear that MacCormack’s lovely voice has gone. But he will still be able to hold an audience by his diction. How Giorgio and I used to wrangle about this! By the way, what did you do for my birthday? It is a great shame I didn’t get one tenth part of the attention and flattery this year to which I am entitled by act of parliament. A miserable meal at Fouquet’s for a poor 1000 frs or so! No high kicking or choruses or cake and candles or people shaking my hand and saying ‘We never saw you looking so handsome as you do tonight’ while I sit in a corner on the floor with a bottle of Vouvray in each of my four pockets and two cigars in my mouth nodding at all the men and winking at all the women. Well, Stevie, I hope you’ll have a merrier one on the 15th. I met Gorman here today…. He says he will go to Ireland in autumn and start again on the book in September. He has a daughter 22 months old. We went to Ferrari’s for lunch and who should walk in but my wife. I find it impossible to avoid that woman. She is everywhere. Last night I took the harem to see Man of Aran where I yawned my head off with boredom. I am going to hear a Japanese bass on Thursday. I shall send Giorgio the bass aria from the 3rd act of Rimsky’s Kittege which Zoporofetz sang so splendidly. As for La Forza del Destino! This opera used to make Italians cry with laughter but Herr Franz Werfel discovered it (and incidentally Giuseppe Verdi) and of course all the Deutschers clapped like anything. Then Covent Garden patted its polite mits. And so on. The prima donna who sang it in Trieste was called La Valanga (The Avalanche). Verdi wrote it for Russia, so you see, in fact Taubulik created the tenor part in S. Petersburg. An Italian bass is rare. I have heard only two or three. I am glad you saw some of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. There never was such a collaboration, I suppose. But of course in the end they fell out. The music fits the words like a glove. Has Giorgio tried Schoeck’s music? The interview in New Yorker is the usual thing. They will get tired of me soon and move on to Giorgio himself.",
