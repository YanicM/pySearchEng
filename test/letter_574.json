  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I arrived here with my family three days ago. My intention is to remain here three months in order to write the last adventure Circe in peace (?) and also the first episode of the close. For this purpose I brought with me a recast of my notes and MS and also an extract of insertions for the first half of the book in case it be set up during my stay here. The book contains (unfortunately) one episode more than you suppose in your last letter. I am very tired of it and so is everybody else. Mr Pound wrote to me so urgently from Sirmione (lake of Garda) that in spite of my dread of thunderstorms and detestation of travelling I went there bringing my son with me to act as a lightning conductor. I remained two days there and it was arranged when I explained my general position and wishes that I should follow him on to Paris. I returned to Trieste but I did not believe that I should ever succeed in wheeling the caravan of my family out of it—or if I did that I should ever succeed in reaching Paris. For this reason I thought it better to wait before writing to you and have delayed also a few days since I came here because even then I was by no means sure that I could find rooms here. These have been found and it seems that my address will be rue de l’Assomption, 5, Passy, Paris. But I am not there yet so for a few days more will you please address letters to me c/o Mr Ezra Pound, Hôtel de l’Elysée, rue de Beaune 9, Paris? I hope you duly received Oxen of the Sun which Mr Pound sent you on from Italy. Mr Froment Fels, editor of L’Action, wishes to begin the serial publication of the French translation (to be made by Mme Ludmilla Savitsky who has an article on Mr Aldington in the last issue of the Anglo-French Review) in the next number, to be preceded by a translation of Mr Pound’s article on me in his last book Instigations. He also wishes to draw up a contract for the publication of the novel in book form when the serial publication is complete. You may remember that he wrote to me about this a year and a half ago in Zurich. Mr Lugné Poë, formerly manager of the Odénon and now of the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre, has taken Exiles to consider it for production. A translator for this has also been found and, I believe, a publisher. You would greatly oblige me if you could send me a copy of Exiles for the translator and place the amount to debit of my account. Also if it is not too much trouble I should like three copies of the Egoist, 18 January, 1913, the number which contained the story of Dubliners, as there is someone here who wished or wishes to translate some of the stories. I hope that all this will lead to something practical. It is all due to Mr Pound’s energy. I hope also that I shall be able to finish the twelfth adventure at my ease. Like its fellows it presents for me great technical difficulties and for the reader something worse. A great part of the Nostos or close was written several years ago and the style is quite plain. The whole book, I hope (if I can return to Trieste provisionally or temporarily in October) will be finished about December after which I shall sleep for six months.",
