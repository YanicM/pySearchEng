Faceva un tempo insopportabile quà da tre giorni e perdura. Ti abbraccio Babbo Dear Helen: Glad to have good news of you. All will go well. Lucky you got off on Wednesday as on Thursday we had a dreadful storm just at that hour. David is coming to tea and after we work till dinner. Tomorrow he and his friend —— are to dine with us. I can’t find any other paper or envelopes so here goes this. Huebsch dined with us last night and asked kindly for both of you. Invitations keep pouring in from all kinds of emplâtres. Jolas seems to have gone off somewhere, I suppose for the weekend. He didn’t even dine with us the night you all left. Stevie, I hear flourishes. Be good Babbo",
