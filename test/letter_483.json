  "text": "Dear Mr Sykes: Please change the word ‘captive’ in phrase ‘Mr Deasy held his nose captive for a few moments’ etc to ‘tweaked’. The reason I trouble you so often is that I make notes on stray bits of paper which I then forget in the most unlikely places, in books, under ornaments and in my pockets and on the back of advertisements. I hope you arranged about the machine. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
