  "text": "Dear Stannie, I read in the D.M. under the heading ‘Riot in a Dublin Theatre’ that a ‘clerk’ named Patrick Columb and someone else were put up at the Police Courts for disorderly conduct in the Abbey Theatre at a performance of Synge’s new play ‘The Playboy of the Western World’. The story, I believe, is of a self-accused parricide with whom all the girls of a district FALL IN LOVE. The clerk P.C. said (he was fined 40s or 14 days) that nothing would deter him from protesting against such a slander on Ireland. There was also booing at certain strong expressions in the play. The evening ended in confusion. A Trinity college youth created another row by singing ‘God save the King’. W.B.Y. gave evidence and said he could not hear one word of the play. When the police were first called in it was he and L.G. who asked them to withdraw. They had decided, on account of the organised opposition, to run the play for a week longer than they had first intended. He would send free tickets to any who had been prevented from hearing the play. It was Synge’s masterpiece, he said: an example of the exaggeration of art (I am glad he has got a phrase to add to that priceless one of Saint Boooooof about style). Synge was interviewed and said he claimed the right as an artist, to choose whatever subject he wished! I am waiting for the Dublin papers. Columb must either have been forsaken by Kelly or have returned to his office since he is called a clerk. I suspect Synge’s naggin is on the increase. I knew, before now, that there was a schism in the theatre: as all of Columb’s plays have been given by the ‘Irish Theatre’ and the reviews of Yeats and Lady Gregory and Miss HORNYMAN’s productions which have appeared lately in Sinn Féin have been hostile. Yeats says the Irish obeyed great leaders in the past but now they obey ignorant committees. I believe Columb and the Irish Theatre will beat Y and L.G. and Miss H: which will please me greatly, as Yeats cannot well hawk his theatre over to London. However I am sure that many of the hermetists don’t know which to choose. It is lucky for O.G. that his mourning allows him to wait a little longer. Synge will probably be condemned from the pulpit, as a heretic: which would be dreadful: so that Stiffbreeches and Ryan really ought to start another paper in defence of free thought, just for a week or so. I’m sure Ryan is the man for it. I suppose Sinn Féin and The Leader will find out all about Synge’s life in Paris: which will be nice for Lady G and Miss H. And as for pore old A.E. I suppose he is nibbling cabbages up in Rathgar in quite an excited frame of mind at the amount of heresy which is rife in Dublin. Starkie writes a poem in Sinn Féin about the world-fruit withering on the tree and there being none to pluck it. But enough now of the mummers. That Southern X chap, SEÑOR Bulfin, who is I am assured an Irishman, has a letter in Sinn Féin, ridiculing a Union Jack regatta in Galway. Two columns are consumed by his account of the talk of the classes. Ex: ‘Nice weather’ ‘O, chawming’ ‘Chawming regatta’, ‘O, rawtha’ ‘Funny how little interest the country takes in these kind of things’ ‘Quite too awfully funny, doncherknow!’ He makes great fun of the shake-hands over a five-bar gate and the [breaks off]",
