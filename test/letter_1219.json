  "text": "Dear Budgen, I got a long and very friendly letter from Mrs Fleiner of which I will write you when I have made the inquiries it involves. Can I ask you to do me a pressing favour? I received Lucia’s lettrines this morning from those bunglers. At once wired to my Dutch publisher who is to do them (he did my last fragment). He was leaving for London and wired me to send them there to ‘Basil Street Hotel’. This address seems to me rather queer so I shall send them registered to you, writing him at the same time that you will hand them to him personally. Show him your book. I am telling him of it. His name is Carl ver Hulst. I want the lettrines out in time for the Xmas market, if possible. Tell me what you think of them. Sincerely yours James Joyce PS. Could you ring up Miss Weaver and let her see the lettrines as you are on your way to deliver them?",
