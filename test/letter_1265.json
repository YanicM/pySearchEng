  "text": "Dear Curran: I was very sorry to hear from my friend Léon of the death of your mother. I remember her as an amiable and friendly woman and I know enough of your filial piety to understand what your grief must be. You have, I suppose, consolations which I cannot hope to offer you. Nevertheless please accept my sympathy. There is no reason whatever why you should be surprised at receiving a copy of my daughter’s lettrines. This is only in fulfilment of a promise I made you in Westmoreland Street some thirty odd years ago now. I also thank you (as does my wife) for your well meant kindness to her and I was much touched by your appreciation of the beauty and delicacy of the little work she has done.",
