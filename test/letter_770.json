  "text": "Dear McAlmon: You will see by enclosed that the flat scheme fell through after a lot of suspense. Quinn did not reply to my cable but finally wrote to say he had sold the MS for $1975. On the same day he bought back two poems by George Meredith (about 70 pp of MS) for $1400 or 1500. He offered to send me half of the net proceeds less fees, etc in six months. I wrote declining to accept it. I do not think he will put my letter up for auction. Ford has come so often to the well and talked about support given me in the past that I have consented to give him the four masters bit (which is only a sidepiece) for his next number. The review is very shabby in my opinion…. I envy you down there in the sun. But it is very far. I could not go alone and Giorgio who badly needs air does not care to leave the others alone and I could not pilot the four and if we went there would be no place to come back and the expense, and there is not a shred of news from those solicitors or from Miss Weaver (who, I fear, must be ill in some way) and the Ulysses MS has been a fiasco and there seems no prospect of anything getting settled! I continue to work but I might as well be a galleyslave, never stopping from 8 a.m. to 12.30 and from 2 to 8 p.m. By doing so at least I avoid meeting people who admire me immensely and will surely find me a flat…. The weather here is like a methodist minister’s dream of purgatory. I wish I were there to sit in the sun, and rest. What do you say? I don’t like the pension idea. Do you like the red mullets they grill there (rouget)?",
