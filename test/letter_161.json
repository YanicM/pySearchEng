  "text": "Dear Stannie I am very sorry I should be the cause of your unfortunate plight. I have spent very little money this money [sic] over what was necessary but even that it pains me to have spent. I cannot manage till Monday. I have 4 lire but I will ask the man to let us eat there till Monday. I suppose I can count on money from you then. This month must be the last of this wretched embarrassment. Jim. P.S. Give these people no news of me. I suppose they would be glad to hear I was in difficulties. A will certainly advance you the money for a suit. Do you get enough to eat. I hope your toothache is gone.",
