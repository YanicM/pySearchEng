  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I am sending you by successive posts the three acts of my play Exiles which you can submit to Mr Hichards for publication. I should like to have his decision as soon as possible and should like the date of publication to be not later than November 1917. If he accepts it perhaps he would have it set up now so that the typescript may be sent to my publisher in New York for an American edition. As regards its production in America perhaps Mr John Quinn (who has done a long article on my novel in Vanity Fair (New York, May: 1917) could help you if you are not in relation with an American agent yourself. Has the Abbey Theatre refused it or is it to be returned in case the Stage Society does not put it on? I enclose a few more corrections of printerâ€™s errors and return the A/S of my book of stories. I do not know whether my verses, sent some months ago, were printed in Poetry. If not Mr Pound can have them. I understand that an American edition of Chamber Music was arranged for also. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
