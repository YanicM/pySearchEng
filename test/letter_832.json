  "text": "Dear Mr. Walsh: I am glad to hear that the first number of your review will shortly appear. It was a very good thought of yours dedicating this number to Mr. Ezra Pound and I am very happy indeed that you allow me to add my acknowledgement of thanks to him to the others you are publishing. I owe a great deal to his friendly help, encouragement and generous interest in everything that I have written, as you know there are many others who are under a similar debt of gratitude to him. He helped me in every possible way in the face of very great difficulties for seven years before I met him, and since then he has always been ready to give me advice and appreciation which I esteem very highly as coming from a mind of such brilliance and discernment. I hope that your review, setting out under so good a name will have the success which it deserves Sincerely yours, James Joyce",
