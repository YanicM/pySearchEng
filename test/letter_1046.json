  "text": "Dear Davidson, I enclose the original with translation of the Genoese and Neapolitan notices of Sullivan which you kindly promised to forward to general Dawes with a covering note of your own. I understand from Sullivan that the Chicago Opera of which General Dawes is a patron is in search of renors [tenors] for the coming season. I hope these notices may bring about as they should Sullivanâ€™s engagement. Many thanks to you in any case for what you have tried to do. Sincerely yours. James Joyce",
