  "text": "Dear Mr Goyert: I got both your letters but did not know what to reply. First, I have not seen any of your translation of A.L.P. so can form no judgment. Second, as regards your financial position I do not imagine I could find the money for you. The whole world is in crisis. Here we are in a hotel, looking for a flat after 12 years in Paris. I have been cheated out of 6 months rent in London but everyone has the same story to tell. I hope things improve soon. I have a sister and 3 children and part of a brother’s family dependent on me. The only country that seems to be prospering is this one but no doubt it will go into the maelstrom too. Ora pro nobis.",
