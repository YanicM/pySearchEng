If new tenant enters store furniture except table in my room and desk (which Mrs Borsieri will take, I am sure) and MSS and papers (which Mrs Francini will take). I await your remittance. 60 crowns is mine for the Piccolo articles and at least another £2.15.0 has been advanced by me to Charlie and Eva who say they have not heard from you for nearly two months. I gave the money believing you would refund. If you are short and have been I presume you can raise it. Every day is an expense but I shall not leave Dublin till I have arranged something about my book. Best says I have been treated ‘shockingly’ and wants me to speak with Longworth. Interview with Roberts tomorrow. I send English Review. Read and ponder passages marked. Inform the agent and Picciola I cannot leave as I have my affari to attend to and I shall sue them for your and my losses over their conduct. Send what I asked and am due. Jim",
