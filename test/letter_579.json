  "text": "Dear Stannie, MSS of Ulysses arrived safely and I sent them on. Odyssey very much in the air here. Anatole France is writing Le Cyclope, G. Fauré the musician an opera Penelope. Giraudoux has written Elpenor (Paddy Dignam). Guillaume Apollinaire Les Mamelles de Tirésias, I hope during the week to have definite news about translations of novel and play. First chapter of former nearly finished. The translator, a Madame Bloch, put this flat at my disposal, free, for three months. She has two. Pound wanted to get the Duchess of Marlborough to apply for the position vacated by Mrs M. but her bloody old father W K Vanderbilt died here in the next street to us the day before yesterday, very inconsiderately, I think. It is not impossible that Giorgio will get some kind of temporary work to keep him from yawning in the office of the brother-in-law of my other translator (of the play) Mlle. Jeanne Serruys. Lugné Poe is to give his decision next Friday about putting it on at L’Oeuvre. Called to Burberry’s here who are laying in autumn and winter stocks. As regards the revolver university, perhaps the place is closed, in which then there is 850 or 1000 lire there for me. I forget which. Anyway give Francini 100 of it and ask Frank to have made out a cheque (not crossed to me on their Paris bankers for the equivalent of the rest in French franks—which please send on to me registered and express. I enclose a letter for him. If you get this on Wednesday, say, you might call to school and see Benedetti. The best time is between 12.30 and 2 so that if the place is closed for repairs you can get the cash or, if not, arrange to get it on Saturday and Frank can prepare the cheque on Friday. We read about the troubles in Trieste. Those in Ireland are still worse. I regretted to observe the barometric depression to which you allude. The perusal of my innocent pages is the only dispeller of illusions which repays the money invested. Madam Circe advances regally towards her completion after which I hope to join a tennis club. Jim Caro Frank: Vuoi farmi il piacere di far prepare [sic] uno chèque su Parigi (non sbarrato) per l’importo in franchi francesi equivalente a 750 lire italiane. Stannie ti rimetterà il denaro che deve incassare alla scuola per me. Grazie d’anticipo. Tempo bellissimo qui ed un quartiere ammobiliato gratis. Siamo vicini al bosco di Bologna d’una parte ed alla Senna dell’altra. Spero che Eileen si sia rimessa della sua indisposizione. Salutamela—nonche le bambine. Non posso scrivere con questa vanga di penna. Fammi sapere se vuoi degli assignats del periodo della rivoluzione francese. Saluti cordiali Jim",
