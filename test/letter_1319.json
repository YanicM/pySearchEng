  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: Do you or does Mr Giedion know anyone who has influence in Neuchatel? My brother Stanislaus has applied for a post there as professor of English in the Ecole Superieure de Commerce, director M. Vuillener. My brother has been a teacher of English all his life, is 48 and has held my post as professor of English in the University of Trieste since 1919. He is married to a Triestine Swiss, born Lichtensteiger. On account of the British Italian friction he was dismissed from his post at the University of Trieste a few months ago and an order of expulsion was issued that he should leave Italy. But the then foreign Secretary Fulvio Suvich was our pupil from before the war and the expulsion order was revoked or rather suspended. He was not reinstated in the university and finds the moral surroundings so intolerable that he has applied for this rather poorly paid post—6000 Sw. frs per annum. He has no children. I am writing prof. Fleiner and Edmond Jaloux but perhaps you know somebody. I hope you have got Lucia’s book. Friendly greetings to both James Joyce",
