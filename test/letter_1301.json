  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: The enclosed are for the camera for Lucia, please, if Miss Walker or yourself can go to Reigate. I sent this money weeks ago to Mrs Curran in London but she had left the Euston. No address…. I am delighted to hear that Lucia is getting on so well…. I would like her to buy a nice fur coat. I wrote to Mrs Budgen who is an expert and can get these things cheaper. Could I have a view of where you are?… Hoping you are well and asking you to wait a little longer for my promised letter.",
