  "text": "Dear Larbaud: They tell me you are at present in town and I am writing to know, first of all, if you are both well, as I hope you are, and secondly whether you purpose staying here through the summer or not. I suspect you will not stay here and as I myself purpose setting up residence permanently in Paris again after a break of two years I wondered whether your flat would be rentible during June–August. I should like to have a small quiet flat to work in all the summer while my wife is house-hunting and then to move into fixed quarters about September. All my furniture is stored here. I am in a meublé as I gave up my Kensington flat as unsatisfactory. We are only three and even Lucia may be away part of the summer. But even if you do stay on or do not wish to let your place I should be glad to see you or even hear from you. The leaflet enclosed may interest you. Do you know L. Gillet. He often asks me about you but I have no news to give him. I suppose you know that Miss B. is no longer my publisher. The Albatross Press took over U and it is having a big international sale in its 13th edition. Honi soit qui mal y compte! Sincerely yours James Joyce",
