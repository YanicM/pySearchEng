  "text": "Dear Miss Beach: Will you please order the following books (American) for me: 1) English Speech and Literature by E. Vizetelly 2) Ireland’s Part in the Making of Britain by O.J. Fitzpatrick? Perhaps Brentano’s has them. Also can you get me any information about 1) New Book of Kings by Davidson 2) The Complete Peerage (8 vols) edited by Lord Howard de Walden. A dreadful thunderstorm passed by here on Monday. Luckily we got only the fringe of it—quite enough—but London was terrified. It is very hot. My complexion is now cinnabar and rosbif à l’anglaise and sienna and extra ochre and deep walnut etc. I have also catalogued about 40 pp. of notes in spite of the heat wave. Giorgio’s telegram and subsequent letter about the flat were decisive against our taking it. I made an alternative proposal that we take it and barter it, if unsuitable—that is, dispose of the bail without profit in exchange for a more suitable flat of similar size but of a much dearer rent. He has not written about that so I suppose it is off. In any case, will you please thank Mme Tisserand for keeping it open for me and give her from my account 100 francs which I shall settle at our next meeting. As Giorgio has nothing to do I hope he will find what we want. He knows what will suit, I presume. I had to visit the oculist twice in London with these — glasses. The improvement of sight is so slow that I have given up thinking about it. Lucia will go to Deauville about the end of the month I think. I expect to go to Cornwall then. In any case it would be useless for either of us to return to Paris now—worse than useless for me as I know nothing about flats except that they are presumably flat not hilly. You will be glad to hear that Miss Weaver made me a couple of days ago the very great gift of another £12,000 (twelve thousand pounds) equivalent at today’s exchange rate of 936,000 frs. This throws some light on the situation. In view of benefactions of various provenences it ought to be pointed out that the sum for which the MS of Ulysses was acquired is equivalent to the interest for 6 weeks on the total sum (£21,000) made over to me by her. Mme du Pasquier wrote hopefully about Exiles being played in the Elysian Fields. Is not this adding a new horror to eternal punishment? Yeats wrote me a pressing invitation to stay with him in Dublin where, he says, there are many who share his admiration of me and a new literary generation anxious to meet me. I thanked him amicably and declined. Please thank Miss Monnier also for the trouble she took. I am sending Fargue a funny advertisement which please translate for him while he fans himself with his hat. Many thanks to yourself for your telegram and letter but as I am not on the spot (and should be only in the way if I were) it is better to work through Georgio who is reputed to be the best living authority on the manners, customs, institutions, privileges, perquisites, hereditary and acquired domestic characteristics of the Joyce family abroad. With kind regards yours sincerely James Joyce",
