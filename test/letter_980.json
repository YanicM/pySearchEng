  "text": "Dear Mr Conner I have been ill with my eyes the last three weeks and could not write, so I am dictating the present letter. I was much relieved to receive the copies of parts 10 and 11 of Work in Progress and to know that the copyright of this portion of the book also has been properly taken out in my name in the United States. I hope you have received for this purpose also copies of Transition No 13 (the quarterly); if not, will you kindly ring up Miss Beach. As regards the suit against Mr Roth, it would be foolish of me to oppose my opinion to that of your partners in New York, but if there is, in their opinion now, no case against him under copyright or property laws and no prospect of recovering any of the money he has probably safely disposed of, gained by misuse of my name and mutilation of my work, I suggest at least that they press for some judgment—nominal damages of one dollar, with an injunction against any further use of my name—which, when recorded, may establish a precedent in case law in favour of unprotected European writers, whose cause in this instance is mine also. Believe me, dear Mr Conner, sincerely yours James Joyce",
