  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for the very liberal advance of royalties on Ulysses (Paris edition) for which I enclose receipt. I am glad you see no fatigue in Circe. Her web is so vast and of such intricate zoological design that I suppose it must be hard to follow in such a typescript. A few threads have fallen out to say nothing of the rent made in it. I would have sent on the typescript of Oxen of the Sun with this for Mr Eliot but that this with all the copies of the Little Review was lent to Mrs Harrison to enable her, as she said, to follow the names and allusions in Circe when typing. I have written to her twice but can get no reply. I am trying to find out where she works. I hope her husband has not burnt them also. I quite approve of course of your writing to Mr Pinker and agree with all you may say on that point. Mr Pound gave me the cuttings I sent you. He also showed me two letters from the editors of the Little Review which is now to become a quarterly with Mr Pound again as foreign editor. I glanced through the letters and it seems Ulysses will now be dropped so that I suppose the Oxen of the Sun will not even be printed in it. This is immaterial as the book is fairly well known. Mr Pound is planning with some friends an article or manifesto about it. Nevertheless I shall present the typescript to him (another copy) for forwarding as I have done hitherto knowing that it will never appear in the review. Tomorrow evening I hope to send you a proof of the prospectus. The printer’s estimate of paging and cost was, as I discovered, full of mistakes and now he has reduced his figure by 7000 francs, I hear. This explains the delay. I am doing all I can to launch the raft on which this ‘hero’ will embark for posterity—to the intense relief of all his contemporaries. I perceive smiles of satisfaction all round me emanating from readers who have been informed officially that there are only two more episodes, both reasonably short, and no sequel. Many thanks again for your aid which illuminates the dismal labyrinth I seem to walk in.",
