  "text": "Dear Eliot: … I cannot go to Zurich, of course, though Vogt sent me a message to come. A French cook took my London flat for 3 months. I am giving it up anyway. I worked all the winter and wish I could go on. Giorgio and family are in the south of France. Gorman seems to have vanished. Two Japanese pirated editions of Ulysses have appeared this spring and 13,000 copies have been sold to date. Is Japan a signatory to the Berne convention or not? Ulysses stands under French law. The pirates allege that European books become public property in Japan after 10 years. You remember somebody in your office advised me to ask certain terms. The Japanese found these terms and advance absurd as my lease had only 6 months to run. U was published 2/2/1922 and the first Japanese edition came out in Tokyo on 5/2/1932. No news from the American publishers…. The moment I have any good news I will send it. John Lane is ‘considering’ Ulysses with the assistance of a Home Office man and a police solicitor. It is rather unfair and most un-English that the army and navy, the fire brigade and the Worshipful Fraternity of Frothblowers are not represented on their committee of public safety.",
