  "text": "Dear Mr Sykes: Yes. Ulysses has been done by the same man. It is not his fault, he is forced to do it on time. The edition will be dear (£10 a copy) very luxurious etc and [?] not scamped. I cannot control them completely but something I can do. Proofs will be sent to you 100 pp at a time. It is very kind of you to say you will look through them. Any ideas that occur you may jot down in the margin. Thanks very much. I got your novel from your publishers I think and shall start to find out the mystery as soon as this lawsuit is well launched. I hope it sells well. I will send you the opening pages of my new book, a piece which will appear here 15 March. If you can solve its ninetynineangular mystery will you please let me know…. We are glad to learn Mrs Sykes and yourself are well. At Ostende this summer we met Devries who is there pulling all the teeth and legs he can.",
