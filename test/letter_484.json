  "text": "Dear Mr Sykes: Herewith M.O for 4 frs with thanks. As regards the corrections could you post back to me the illegible one. I have made the following corrections ‘tweaked’ ‘in ’46’ (‘whey sour’ and ‘department’ were made by you). Please convey my wife’s excuses for her taciturnity both to Mrs Sykes and Mrs Bleibtreu from whom she had a card today. She has been constantly ill and has even had very bad nervous breakdowns here so that I really do not know what to do—whether to go to Z. on the offchance of finding a flat or leaving this pension and looking for a flat here. Instead of doing her good the stay here has made her much worse. But for the dreadful weather you have we would perhaps go back but on the other hand my health has to be thought of. Kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
