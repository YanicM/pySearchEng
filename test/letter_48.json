  "text": "Sweetheart I am in such high good humour this morning that I insist on writing to you whether you like it or not. I have no further news for you except that I told my sister about you last night. It was very amusing. I am going out in half an hour to see Palmieri who wants me to study music and I shall be passing your windows. I wonder will you be there. I also wonder if you are there will I be able to see you. Probably not. What a lovely morning! That skull, I am glad to say, didn’t come to torment me last night. How I hate God and death! How I like Nora! Of course you are shocked at these words, pious creature that you are. I got up early this morning to finish a story I was writing. When I had written a page I decided I would write a letter to you instead. Besides, I thought you disliked Monday and a letter from me might put you in better spirits. When I am happy I have an insane wish to tell it to everyone I meet but I would be much happier if you gave me one of those chirruping kisses you are fond of giving me. They remind me of canaries singing. I hope you haven’t that horrible pain this morning. Go out and see old Sigerson and get him to prescribe for you. You will be sorry to hear that my grand-aunt is dying of stupidity. Please remember that I have thirteen letters of yours at present. Be sure you give that dragoon’s stays to Miss Murphy—and I think you might also make her a present of the dragoon’s entire uniform. Why do you wear these cursed things? Did you ever see the men that go round with Guinness’s cars, dressed in enormous frieze overcoats? Are you trying to make yourself like one of them? But you are so obstinate, it is useless for me to talk. I must tell you about my nice brother, Stannie. He is sitting at the table ½-dressed reading a book and talking softly to himself ‘Curse this fellow’—the writer of the book—‘Who in the devil’s name said this book was good’ ‘The stupid fuzzy-headed fool!’ ‘I wonder are the English the stupidest race on God’s earth’ ‘Curse this English fool’ etc etc Adieu, my dear simple-minded, excitable, deep-voiced, sleepy, impatient Nora. A hundred thousand kisses. Jim",
