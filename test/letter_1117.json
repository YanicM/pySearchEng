  "text": "Dear Stephens: Here is your poem in German, Latin, Norwegian, Italian and French. Can you add your Irish version so as, with the English, to make a rainbow and we might present it to ourselves in a brochure for our jubilee year. The Latin contains violations of quantity (lines 4 and 5 for example) but this really does not matter in the rhymed doggerel which a classic poet would call church verse. In the German ‘liess los’ sounds rather free and vulgar. It is really ‘let a shout’ but I prefer it to the verb ‘stossen’ which is more elegant. In the Italian I made the wind a bandit cousin of Fra Diavolo. He puts three fingers in his mouth to balance the three ‘kills’. This I also balanced by the collision of 3 vowels in line 5. As regards the Norwegian that language has changed in spelling almost as much (I mean since I began to study it in Dublin) as English has since 1600. I have followed the orthography Ibsen used which is now nearer Danish than Norwegian. Those two races still preserve pagan terms. They have no word for Christmas (which they call ‘Jul’) or for the Last Day or General Judgment. This they call ‘Ragnarok’. So line 4 means that the trees think the crack of doom is upon them. Also this typewriter cannot reproduce such Norwegian letters as ‘ø’ or ‘å’. [The five versions (with the original prefixed) are as follows:] The wind stood up and gave a shout. He whistled on his fingers and Kicked the withered leaves about And thumped the branches with his hand And said he’d kill and kill. And so he will and so he will. Le vent d’un saut lance son cri, Se siffle sur les doigts et puis Trépigne les feuilles d’automne, Craque les branches qu’il assomme. Je tuerai, crie-t-il, hol…! Et vous verrez s’il le fera! J.J. Der Wind stand auf, liess los einen Schrei, Pfiff mit den Fingern schrill dabei Wirbelte duerres Laub durch den Wald Und haemmerte Aeste mit Riesengewalt. Zum tod, heult, zu Tod and Mord! Und meint es ernst: ein Wind, ein Wort. J.J. Sur git Boreas digitorum Fistulam faciens et clamorem. Pes pugno certat par (oremus!) Foliis quatit omne nemus. Caedam, ait, caedam, caedam! Nos ne habeat ille praedam. J.J. Vinden staar op med en vild Huru, Han piber paa fingerne og nu Sparker bladenes flyvende flok. Traeerne troer han er Ragnarok. Skovens liv og blod vil han draebe og drikke. Hvad der bliver at goere, det ved jeg ikke. J.J. Balza in piè Fra Vento e grida. Tre dita in bocca fischia la sfida. Tira calci, pesta botte: Ridda di foglie e frasche rotte. Ammazzerò, ei urla, O gente! E diuraddio costui non mente. J.J.",
