  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I do not wish to implicate you in any way in the matter but, unless you have definitely adverse legal opinion, I am anxious the statement should go forward as it stands. It is surely open to a British subject or a man of letters to bring to the notice of the public and of his colleagues such gross and dense abuse of public trust on the part of officials paid by public taxation. Mr Richards wrote to me also. The matter is [of] no importance to him though he seems to think it is. Ulysses will not be finished this year. Neither he nor any other publisher in London would ever publish it or find anyone to print it or to buy it, if printed. I take it you have applied to my New York publisher and to The Egoist requesting them to let me have statement of royalties as soon as possible in view of my plans. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. You can obtain a complete dossier of the case from Mr Richard Aldington, Hotel Littoral, 15 Moon Street. J.J.",
