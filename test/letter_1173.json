  "text": "Dear Stannie: I got your wire of 2 August but no letter since then. Did you write? I ask because the crétin of a concierge in Z’ch has misdirected half my mail. I wish you would drop me a line for I might still be able to fix up something. This is the finest city for its size that I have ever seen and beautifully situated on the banks of the Rhone and the shores of Lake Leman. If you wrote I am sorry but you will have to write again. Jim",
