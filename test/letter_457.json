  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Am writing Mr Richards today. Please fix the matter up with him as soon as possible. Mr Grein, Mincing Lane, wishes to read my play. He is at present in Devon. Will you find out when he will be back and send him on a typescript copy. Have you any relations with the Pioneer Players, or the other theatre I spoke [of] or the Manchester Repertory Theatre or do you know any actor or actress who would read the play? My whole life seems to be taken up with useless correspondence. As regards the date of publication I am making a strong appeal to Mr Richards to comply with my request and you will oblige me by backing it up. I presume the contract will allow me to dispose of American rights. Have you heard from Poetry or have you had accounts from Mr Huebsch? Sincerely yours James Joyce",
