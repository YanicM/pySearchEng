  "text": "Dearest I am awfully disappointed by your letter tonight. All day I was planning to get together the little note I enclose and wondering what you would write to me. I wired you Be careful. I meant be careful to keep my letters secret, be careful to let nobody see your excitement and be careful not to (I am half ashamed to write it now). I was afraid, Nora, you might get so hot that you would give yourself to somebody. Buy something nice with this note, dearest. I shall be dreadfully miserable if these last letters of ours come to an end. I am exhausted with this business here. Last night I was not in bed till near five between letters and advertisements and telegrams. Your letter is so cold I have no heart to write you like before. I have gazed a long time at your other letters and kissed certain words in them, one of them over and over again. Perhaps tomorrow you will write again. Good night, dearest. Jim",
