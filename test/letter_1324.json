  "text": "Dear Mr Hertz: Many thanks to you and your friend for copies of Politiken, The letter to Lucia is just what I wanted. I have written to my German publisher about my book and if and when I get a copy you will receive it. If not an English copy. Are the latter really not on sale in Cologne book shops. I mean, the Odyssey Press edition? Giorgio and Helen are now back in Paris and are rather tired, at least Helen is. He is much stronger. We had a lovely day in Cologne thanks to Mrs Herz and yourself Sincerely yours James Joyce",
