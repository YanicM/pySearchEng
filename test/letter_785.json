All Pandora’s gifts are not maladies. Shaun’s map: for this see any postage stamp of the Irish Free State. It is a philatelic curiosity. A territorial stamp it includes the territory of another state, Northern Ireland. In making notes I used signs for the chief characters. It may amuse you to see them so I shall write them on the back of this. I have been very busy revising over and over the proofs of the four old men, Mamalujo. It comes out this week. They have now taken a lamp out of my room. Miss Beach was here. I showed her the room. There is nothing to be said. Shaun is going to give me a very great deal of trouble.… … T  (Earwicker, H C E by moving letter round) U  Anna Livia Z  Shem-Cain Y  Shaun R  Snake P  S.
