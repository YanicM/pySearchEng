  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: First, a report to G.H.Q. All is quiet on the Western Front. In spite of the pressure of the puritan and Irish Catholic mob in the U.S. the Attorney General would not risk a third legal defeat in the Supreme Court. I won by default and the matter is at an end. Next, please. It took only 18 years to do this but I presume in spite of McAlmon that hoc erat in vobis…. Lord knows what bungling is ahead. But O the boredom of once again fighting an opponent who never knows when he is beaten and always is…. But it is of no matter, for (1st) one copy of Ulysses, much thumbed, is quite enough to go round the whole I.F.S. (2nd) I confidently expect to be ruined mentally, morally and materially by the 17 March next. S. Patrick’s day. I don’t think you can have any idea of what my position is. I am trying to work … I am urged to go away but it is very risky. The idea is to efface myself, and also Jung or someone else to get contact with Lucia. I did for 7 months…. Result, almost irreparable. Lucia has no trust in anyone except me and she thinks nobody else understands a word of what she says. But she also profits by my indulgent character…. How act in such a case. On the 25th October last we visited her or did I tell you this before? I will give it in dialogue. Of course it was in Italian. L. I have been thinking all day of John MacCormack. It is unjust. Why is he a count, a millionaire etc.? I thought of writing to the pope. I. Be careful of your grammar. He is a learned man. L. He’s an old dotard. But it is unjust. How long will your country refuse to recognise what you have done. I. How long indeed? L. I want to reconcile you. It is time for some great person of your country to come forward and hold out a hand to you and to us. I. Hear, hear. On the morning of the 26th at 7 a.m. the hotel page brought me the enclosed cable sent by MacCormack on the 25th. I know him for about 32 years and have never had a line or word from him before by mail, cable or phone. On the 27th appeared in the Irish Times a long and not unfriendly article on W.I.P. the first in 20 years I think…. All the few friends we have here leave Zürich on the 21 or 22. We shall not have a soul to join us. Jolly after 30 years. And word comes from U.S. that Giorgio and Helen are not coming back perhaps till summer, perhaps till etc. And to crown all I have yesterday and today the start of a colitic attack. Yet what I am trying to write is the most absurdly comic thing in the book. Eliot is dusting pews in an Anglo-Catholic church round your corner. Ask him to have an A-C mish-mash mass said for the three Joyses. I believe, hope and am cheered to know that you are extremely well.",
