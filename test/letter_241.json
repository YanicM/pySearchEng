Send as much as you can on 1st as I have laid in a winter stock of clothes and funds are low. When you get this buy half a dozen Brasile cigars and send them in a small box by letter post to Robert Cowell Esq, 14 Ranelagh Avenue, Dublin. Kindly do this by return as Mr Cowell has asked me particularly about them. Jim",
