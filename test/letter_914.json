  "text": "Dear Pound: My lawyer here Conner has had a cable from his partner in N.Y. ‘Have J. search his records to determine whether he sold American copyright to Jane Heap as she claims’. Can you send me a short typewritten note which I can show my lawyer here as to what I gave you from Zurich for the review, how much you paid (£50?), etc? I should like it by return. Roth now offers me $1000 if I will sign a statement to the effect that he offered me that sum before the publication. I do not intend to reply to him. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
