  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I enclose two A/S which I should have sent you before. Address: Will you please note that this is Sanità not Vanità. Exiles: A German translation of this Verbannte made and published at my expense (1900 frcs Swiss for the latter item) came out in Zurich, the house being an old Swiss firm. No A/S has yet been tendered me. Dubliners: Does Mr Richards intend to republish this book or to forfeit his rights thereto? Chamber Music: A second edition of this came out, as I hear incidentally, two years ago. I never received from Mr Mathews any A/S. Swedish translation: I should like to have a copy of this. Italian translation: An Italian translation of Exiles (arranged for by me) will appear in April in an Italian review, act by act; the translator being Mr Carlo Linati translator of Synge. Ulysses: This book is nearing completion. I suggest the contract be now drawn up, one clause being that an advance of royalties be payable on signature. I must get a revise after the first proof so that it would be well to have part of the book set after the drawing up of contract. My text is in typescript not to be tampered with. I shall feel obliged if you will see to this matter at once. Royalties: As I intend to leave Italy on holidays early in summer I shall be glad to have a statement of royalties due on books as soon as possible, say towards the last week in June or first in July. Exiles, production: Has this been offered to the Pioneer Players, Abbey Theatre or other management? Sincerely yours James Joyce",
