  "text": "Dear Mr and Mrs Nutting: Mrs Prost called yesterday and gave us your address and your news after almost nine years I believe. I send you a copy of transition and am hurrying myself with this note to catch the boat train at S. Lazare. Dear Mrs Nutting, we are very sorry to hear you have been in bad health and hope you are recovering. It seems Nutting is well. Tant mieux. Lucia has been terribly ill for over five years. She was given up and still we hoped on. Now it seems that she is at last on the road to recovery. Giorgio is married and we have a grandson Stevie aged 5½. Mrs Wallace is in London. I think she stays with the Mackenzies and is a face masseuse. We have not been to Les Trianons for years as we always go to Fouquet’s. Giorgio had great trouble with his thyroid gland but is now quite cured. Friendliest remembrances from us both James Joyce",
