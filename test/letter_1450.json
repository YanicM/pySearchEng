  "text": "Dear Gilbert and Mrs Gilbert: We hope you are both well and safe. We are here where we came to be near Lucia. I was told and told again that Dr Delmas had rented the hotel Edelweiss here (70 rooms) and park to receive his maison de santé from Ivry and had a fleet of autocars ready to transport sick and staff, and would all be on the road here an hour after the levy in mass was proclaimed. On the strength of these reiterated assurances I left, telling Lucia that I would wait at Beaugency (on the way here) and leave at the same time as she left Ivry and meet her here. The morning after general mobilization I went to the hotel Edelweiss and seeing the ground floor windows at last open asked had the Maison de Santé of Dr Delmas arrived during the night. The caretaker had never heard of any Dr Delmas or Maison de Santé and said the hotel had been rented by the Société des Forges du Nord. Dr Delmas arrived next day. I found him by the merest accident as his wife never even troubled to ring me up to tell me. He told me he was looking for a place but had no means of transport and I could not count on his being able to do anything before 8 or 15 days! He was to return to Paris next day. Through a friend of mine who has a daily priority telephone call to Paris, Dr O’Brien of the Rockefeller Foundation, who ’phoned his secretary in Paris I learned yesterday and now today that there had been several night alarms in Ivry and that the government had evacuated the female patients. At the time of writing I have no idea where my daughter is—this after all my preparations to be near her! … I wrote express to Lucia through Mrs Léon who is in Beaugency, but scarcely knew what to say to her who always counts on me. Heaven knows if she even got the letter….",
