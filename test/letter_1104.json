  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: … Mr Robert Kastor arrived in Marseille from N.Y. the other day. He rang up Giorgio (he is a stockbroker in N.Y.) to say he had an offer in his pocket to me from a friend of his in N.Y. (Cerf, who published Dubliners and Portrait in Modern Library) which he would bring to Paris…. I shall not make a statement at the ‘jubilee’ celebration because apparently there will be none. Brody wrote about it last October already but nothing was done. Miss Beach went away 12 days ago. She came back yesterday. Helen can do nothing. My wife wanted to do something here but we cannot…. There is an offer for the Danish and Norwegian and Swedish rights of Ulysses, for the Danish and Norwegian of Portrait and the Spanish of Exiles. I am still tired and dejected. Mrs Crosby is back. She could do nothing with Lucia’s letters and my text in MS. I have passed a very gloomy month of this jubilee year which opened with my father’s burial. I still believe that if the two specialists I got to see him on Sunday had seen him on Tuesday he might have got through for he was in great form on Boxing Day, playing with his dog Boxer and saying he would come home on Sunday. Everyone liked him except some of his unnatural self-righteous kindred. There was a relief the other night when Sullivan (who was in town for 24 hours) came round with his wife and son and took us out to dinner…. In the end I livened up for he too, like my father, is a Cork man and a tenor. He told me they had to have a police cordon at the stage door in the Lyons theatre when he sang The Jewess on Xmas night but he swore he would never send me another critique lest I should start again.",
