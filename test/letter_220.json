  "text": "My dear little runaway Nora I am writing this to you sitting at the kitchen table in your mother’s house!! I have been here all day talking with her and I see that she is my darling’s mother and I like her very much. She sang for me The Lass of Aughrim but she does not like to sing me the last verses in which the lovers exchange their tokens. I shall stay in Galway overnight. How strange life is, my dear love? To think of my being here! I went round to the house in Augustine Street where you lived with your grandmother and in the morning I am going to visit it pretending I want to buy it in order to see the room you slept in. I have asked them for photographs of you as a girl but they have none. Who knows, darling, but next year you and I may come here. You will take me from place to place and the image of your girlhood will purify again my life. Jim",
