  "text": "Dear Mr Goyert: Many thanks for E.S and the rest. Prof Fey’s article is good but Bloom wears a chapeau melon not a silk hat (he is not yet canonised!) and Mrs Purefoy is not a Putzfrau. ‘Crab’ is a slang word for a pubic parasite (Fr. morpion) ‘Toby Tostoff’ is bogus Russian from the verb ‘to toss off’ an expression for ‘to masturbate’ We have just got back here. We had vile weather in Holland and here it is as bad. Kind regards to Mrs Goyert and yourself James Joyce P.S. I will send N.R.F. when the piece appears.",
