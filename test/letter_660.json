  "text": "Dear McAlmon: I enclose I.O.U. as promised and also a photo cut from Dublin Freeman. On my way back from Gare du Nord a filthy rat ran by me. I was on the lookout for unpleasant news but it happened otherwise. Yesterday after dinner feeling my head light I went to the Alhambra with Giorgio but collapsed in the middle of the programme and was helped out of the theatre and into a taxi by a policeman. I was driven to a night pharmacy and given ether and then home. The attack lasted about an hour. I could scarcely breathe and was very pale and weak—and nerves! Still I don’t think it was cardiac because my nails remained pink. Anyhow I have given up the 16 hours a day work on Ulysses. I will do 5 or 6 or, later on, 8 hours. Walked to the Etoile and back this morning and will take another in the evening. Hope to receive your story and letter soon.",
