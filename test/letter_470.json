Please let me hear from you then. On Monday will you please arrange with Mr Rudolph Goldschmidt about beginning the typing on Tuesday. He can be seen at the Oesterreichischer Wohltätigkeitsverein, Zähringerplatz or ’phoned to there or, if not seen or ’phoned to, between 12/30 and 1/30 at his house, Hüchgasse 29. I remit per M.O. 20 francs in advance as per our agreement. I believe I told you that in present circumstances I should like to have it in duplicate. In very great haste and with kind regards to Mrs Sykes and yourself.",
