  "text": "Dear Sir: A bird alone—a pretty grey finch at present in a cage—flew into our flat through an open window yesterday morning. Perhaps he was scared and sought refuge from the air squadrons then over the city or perhaps he came from Wicklow to remind me that I had not acknowledged receipt of your book. This I do now with thanks. I am afraid, however, that I cannot be of any real service to you. I never write for any journal or periodical and I have not read a novel in any language for very many years so that my opinion is quite worthless. I buy them sometimes when [I] know the writer personally. Nevertheless, I shall take your book away with me when I go away on my holidays next month. It was very kind of you to send me the book. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
