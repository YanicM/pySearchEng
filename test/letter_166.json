  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards, I have received your letter of the 16th and my verse MS for which thanks. As I told you in my last letter I can make no further changes in the MS you have at present, the changes made so far having been made solely in order that stories 13 and 14 might be included. If, however, you wish to stand by our agreement with regard to the original 12 stories I will concede what you ask for in your letter of 23 April: 1) suppression of Two Gallants (and of A Little Cloud) 2) deletion of passage in Counterparts (already deleted) 3) deletion of word ‘bloody’ in Grace (already deleted) If, however, you decide that you cannot publish the original book, as agreed between us, even with these concessions kindly send me back the complete MS by return of post. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
