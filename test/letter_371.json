  "text": "Dear Mr Mencken: It is only now that I am able to acknowledge receipt of your very kind letter of 20 April last. It reached me through my friends in Venice just before the Italian declaration of war and after that it was of course impossible for me to reply. I left Trieste on the 21 June by special permission of the military authorities when the partial evacuation of the city was decided on. After a rather adventurous journey, I arrived here where I am stopping for the present. I wrote at once to my friend in Venice asking him to send on my post. This morning I received the numbers of The Smart Set containing my stories and also the others which you were kind enough to send. No letter has reached me. Possibly they have been delayed by the censor and will be sent on later. In any case I must thank you for having introduced me to your public. I have been reading today with great interest your lively articles. It is almost a year since I read any articles in English about books. I wrote to Mr Huebsch, whose name you gave me, and asked him to let me know whether there is or is to be an American edition of Dubliners. I have not yet had an answer. Perhaps the enclosed press notices of my book may interest you. I shall be very anxious to see American notices if the book comes out there. I am sorry you did not take up the American serial publication of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man but I understand that your review publishes only complete stories. My novel has now come to an end (serially) in the Egoist (London) and is under consideration for publication in book form. As you are so kind as to ask me if I have other material suitable for your review I may say that I have finished a play in three acts Exiles and am engaged on a novel which is a continuation of A Portrait of the Artist and also of Dubliners. I mention the play because I see in one of your numbers a play by Mr Palmer but it is, of course, in one act. I am afraid I am a slow writer. Moreover, I had to struggle nine years to obtain the publication of Dubliners and this has delayed me very much. Excuse me if this letter is very egoistic. I shall certainly bear your kind offer in mind and thank you once again for your friendly letter.",
