  "text": "Dear Roberts Thanks for the book you sent to my son and for copy of Kettle’s book you sent me. I don’t like the binding and lettering of the latter and hope you remember what was decided on for Dubliners. Is that book to be published, as you write, on 20 January definitely? If so, will you let me know whether you have arranged for the sale of 50 copies to Messrs Schimpff of here, whether you have written to Elkin Mathews about remainder copies of Chamber Music and whether you have had a sheet printed for insertion in Dubliners containing extracts of press notices of Chamber Music. You write that you have sent me proofs of Ivy Day in the Committee-Room. None reached me. Why do you send it? I made corrections on the proof already sent. A friend of mine here wishes to order from you some books by Yeats. Can you send on a list of those you published? Best wishes for the New Year, very sincerely yours James Joyce",
