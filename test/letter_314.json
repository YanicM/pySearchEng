  "text": "Dear Stannie I spent yesterday with Roberts discussing binding, paper, advertisement &c of the book. This morning I called and received the enclosed letter. Roberts was not there as he had arranged. After having received it I sat for an hour in a sofa in Lidwell’s office thinking if I would buy a revolver and put some daylight into my publisher. I showed the letter to Lidwell who said I had been badly treated but that I could do nothing and the publishers were quite right as what he had seen of the book was objectionable. Then I went to Pappie who told me to put the letter in my pocket, buck up, take back the MSS and find another publisher. Then I went to May who said quietly ‘O well, you expected that, didn’t you?’ I went to Roberts and spoke to him from three to five. My defense was: i) A railway co. is mentioned once and then exonerated from all blame by two witnesses, jury and coroner. ii) Public houses are mentioned in four stories out of 15. In 3 of these stories the names are fictitious. In the 4th the names are real because the persons walk from place to place (Counterparts) iii) Nothing happens in the public houses. People drink. iv) I offered to take a car and go with Roberts, proofs in hand, to the 3 or 4 publicans really named and to the secretary of the railway co. He refused. v) I said the publicans would be glad of the advertisement. vi) I said that I would put fictitious names for the few real ones but added that by so doing the selling value in Dublin of the book would go down. vii) I said that even if they took action for libel against Maunsel that the jury would be a long time before awarding damages on such a plea. viii) I said that his legal adviser was a fool to advise him to sue me. If he sued me (even if I lived in Dublin) a jury would say he had the MS for 10 months and I was not liable for his error in judgment. But if he sued me in Trieste I would hold the whip and would laugh him out of court. ix) I suggested that his lawyer encouraged correspondence and litigation for his own profit. Exhausted I stopped. Roberts walked about, noted on a paper and said he would write again to London and let me know on Monday. No letter letter [sic] has reached me from you and no remittance. I am therefore helpless and newsless. However, I presume you will write tomorrow morning. I will fight to the last inch with every weapon in my power. Jim [Enclosure to above letter]",
