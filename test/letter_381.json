  "text": "Dear Sir I am obliged by your favour of 26 instant and return you duly filled up under separate registered cover the printed form which you forwarded me. At the outbreak of war I was in Trieste where I have lived for the last eleven years. My income there was derived from two sources: i) my position in the Higher School of Commerce ii) private lessons. After the outbreak of war I was confirmed in my position by the Austrian Ministry of Public Instruction, Vienna, from whom I held and hold it. The school however closed in spring, nearly all the professors having been called up as officers of the reserve. My second source of income in normal times, viz., private lessons, produced very little in the first months and nothing at all in the next months owing to the critical conditions of the city. In these circumstances I lived with great difficulty and was obliged to recur to the assistance of friends, as stated under. When, one month after the Italian declaration of war, the military authorities decided on the partial evacuation of the city I asked for, and obtained at once, a safe conduct for myself, my wife and children to the Swiss frontier. I have been here one month now. I received from a relative of my wife’s a small sum of money, £15, of which some remains. In order to leave Trieste I effected a loan on my furniture and this sum went for trainfare (owing to the fact that the railways of Trentino and South Tyrol were in our war zone we were obliged to come by a circuitous route) and clothing. I receive nothing in the way of royalties. My contributions to reviews etc were made twelve years ago. From my first publisher and from my second I did not receive any money for royalties, the sale in both cases being below the required number. In the case of my second publisher I bought and paid for at trade prices 120 copies of my book as a condition of publication. For my contributions to reviews in the current year, The Smart Set and The Egoist, I received no payment. I enclose a medical certificate which attests my state of health and shall be much obliged if you will kindly return it to me under registered cover when it has been examined. In present circumstances in this country where I may have to remain for some time it seems very difficult to obtain any work of the kind which I do. My literary work during the last eleven years has produced nothing. On the contrary my second book Dubliners cost me a considerable sum of money owing to the eight years of litigation which preceded its publication. I have tried to obtain an engagement with several schools here but have not succeeded. I trust that I have given you a clear statement of the facts of the case. I am writing to my friends Mr W B Yeats and Mr Ezra Pound who, I am sure, will corroborate me in my statements. I am, dear Sir, Sincerely yours James Joyce Debts contracted in the course of the war. 1 Medical Certificate",
