  "text": "Dear Eileen: One letter to save time so you may read this to Lucia. Your letter of Tuesday bears no address and if I had not asked Lucia where she was living when she telephoned I should not know where to send this. I hope the address is correct. In your letter you urge me to arrange for your departure for Ireland as soon as possible. In your wire of a few hours later you urge me to telegraph forbidding such a departure. The letters I receive from you and Miss Weaver are all contradictory. Lucia told me she wants a man to accompany her from Holyhead at least. I can think of nobody today. On Monday or Tuesday of next week there is a young Irishman here named Murphy who could pick her up in London. But it is a long wait for her. Curran, the only person I know in Dublin, could not leave his job. Anyhow I enclose the £2 Lucia asked for. How much do you pay in the boarding-house?… Where does Lucia want to go to in Ireland—that earthly paradise? I enclose a letter from Galway from which you or she can draw what conclusions you like. But if she wants to go there or to Bray all right. In the last ten days I have sent with enclosed £15, £3 to you in Dublin £3 refund to Miss Weaver who sent them to you £1 and £5 to Lucia and now £2. When you want more as of course you will (and I forgot the £2.13. cheque) state plainly the amount. Nora thinks you ought to leave on receipt of this as there is a spell of good weather on. And alone as you did from here. She is not very keen on Lucia’s going to Galway as she anticipates trouble when her people find out that she doesn’t go to holy mass, holy confession, holy communion and holus bolus. However she thinks the air will do her good. Also Irish eggs are famous all over the world. Miss Weaver wrote to me that Lucia had been rude to her. I shall be much obliged if you will let me know exactly what took place and by return. While you stay with Lucia I will pay your salary £2 a week and of course pay for both your board unless some other person does so. [Unsigned] P.S. Have just had a ring up from Mr Murphy. He leaves Paris on 18 but stays in London a few days and will not leave for Dublin till the 21st",
