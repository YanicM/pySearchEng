  "text": "Dear Pound: Miss Beach has sent you the typescript I had made for you. As you know the Dial accepted it for $650 and then cabled a refusal. It has now been accepted for publication in an annual which a number of American writers bring out in February for $200. It is the whole of part 3 of the book. There are 4 parts, divided each into 4 sections. Some of part 1 appeared in Contact, Criterion, This Quarter and Le Navire dâ€™Argent (the end of that part). A piece of part 2 was in the Transatlantic Review. None of part 4 has been printed. Please let me know what you think of it. The sign on the cover means nothing. It is to distinguish it from other similar books. I use the signs Y Z U T etc through my notes instead of letters as they are quicker to make and read as references. I hope Mrs Pound and yourself are well and that you especially are getting stronger down there Kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
