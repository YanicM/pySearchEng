  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker My friend in Venice has just sent me on your letter of 27 ult which of course I had not received through Venice as it was sent after the Italian declaration of war. I have also received by the same mail a letter from Mr B.W. Huebsch, 225 Fifth Avenue, New York. He tells me that he has not published an American edition of the stories but handed over two of them to the editor of the Smart Set. The July issue of that magazine contains two of the stories. Mr Huebsch asks me about my novel. I have written to say that you have now the disposal of its book rights (British and American) and suggested that he should put himself into communication with you. I hope and believe that under your management my affairs will go better. They could scarcely go worse. I have taken rooms at above address for the present, not knowing where else to go or what to do. A letter, however, sent me either here or to the Gasthof Hoffnung will reach me. I look forward to your letter with great interest. After nine years of useless struggle about Dubliners (ending in a discreet financial failure) I hope things will change. I am sending a line to Mr Wells so that if he be in my neighbourhood he may permit me to thank him personally for having brought my writings under your notice Sincerely yours James Joyce",
