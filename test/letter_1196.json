  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: Eppur non si muove, as he whom this street is called after might have said but didn’t. The flat in the Monceau part fell through. The fool of a landlord was out of town and, though I had an oral agreement with the agent, the latter would not let me sign on. Worse luck for him for in the intervening 10 days Nora-Mamma and Mrs Jolas came to the conclusion it was not such a good bargain. Too big, noisy part, not enough light. So I called it off. And now the hunt begins anew. Young Mr Exton arrived in Paris at 7 a.m. yesterday (30 June). He rang me up and said he had decided to leave in 24 hours. He was lunching with your friend so I asked him to tea. He gave me news of you both, told me he had written a book under my influence at 17 called A Spirit in Search of Itself. He was very sunburnt. I took a taxi and for 2 hours drove him all over Paris or a good part of it and the Bois where they were preparing for the floodlit race by night at Longchamp—a wonderful scene it seems. When we got back the chauffeur asked me if I was a guide of the Maison Cook…. We dine in Fouquet’s very frequently, in fact almost always. It has become a chic prize-ring. The other night an advanced lady slapped a perfect gentleman’s face on account of another perfect lady’s being with him. The well bred diners jumped up on benches and chairs. And the row went on. I refused to have any attention distracted from the business in hand, to wit, a carafe of champagne nature but I could hear a great deal. Again a few nights ago there was a sudden scuffle, blows, fall of plates, shrieks of women etc. Léon was with us. My wife became a little alarmed but I did as before and she is getting used to it. Some people are so playful. Also at Fouquet’s coming out on last Thursday, a man came up to me. He was Denis MacSwiney (Helen, pronounce this to rhyme with ‘queeny’ and also Móran not Moràn and Máhony not Mahòny). He asked me to dinner and then I asked him. He was well posted about Giorgio’s arrival in N.Y. and about the appeal against me which he thinks the government will lose by a 2 to 1 ruling. He cannot work directly for Giorgio as he is under contract to work only for MacCormack but he asked for Giorgio’s address and will call him up in September. He says he will hear him and that MacCormack should too. We got the impression that a retirement of the latter may be contemplated and that he is on the lookout. He made on me the impression of being an uncommonly shrewd Irish country type but capable of a steady loyalty in the case of someone whom he had taken to. He has managed J.M. very well for 25 years and both have made money but apart from that it is easy and refreshing to note that he has a real devotion to his idol. Be jabers, children, ’tis very hot this first of Caesar’s month! … I am sorry to note that as a result of the sea voyage Giorgio is over a half-foot shorter than when he left since the reporter found him to be of medium height. But shure plaise the Lord he’ll be shootin’ up again on the way back and be his owld six foot wan be the time yiz are landed in the French metrollops.",
