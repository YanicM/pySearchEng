  "text": "Dear Stannie The story about the flat is this. I received on 24 Feb notice. That was unpleasant but valid. I then with Nora went about looking for a flat and visited thirty. The house agent himself stopped me in via Bellini and asked me had I found a flat. I said no. He said the matter would be smoothed over, to leave it to him, that he did not want me to leave as he did not know what kind of people might come into the flat, that Picciola was very fond of me and intended to take English lessons from me during the winter and that if any repairs were necessary he even believed that Picciola would pay for them!!! Similar conversations took place 4 times. I told the porter and every one who visited the flat that I was remaining. When I paid the last quarter I asked had he spoken to Picciola. He said he would see in a few days and repeated the story about English lessons. I consider (and will contest by force and by law) that this is a verbal revocation of the notice. On the strength of it I left Trieste. I have written the whole story to Picciola himself and say, if he will not have me in the house, I shall vacate the flat for the 24 Feb or 24 November: For the 24 Aug. no. The house agent did a nice thing to rescind the contract with the incoming tenant. Tell him to sign a contract with nobody. He has played a double game (as I told Picciola who is a pig, in any case) and has only himself to blame. But for his intervention I should have found a flat. I have also written to Eileen to explain the matter to Serravallo. If in spite of that Picciola insists on putting me and my family on the street I promise you you will see some fun in the house. If he does so he is an inhuman person and I will treat him as such. I am however almost sure that he will agree to my proposal. In the meantime if you have nothing better to do call again on the houseagent and let him know that I intend to remain in that house after the 24 Aug and that if anything bad happens the result will lie at his door. Take possession of the house till I return. Don’t let my debts trouble you. Tell them I am away and will return in the month of September. They would get the same answer at Economo’s door and would salute and go away. Fano perhaps would be nasty not the others. Have just finished second article on Aran and will send. Send on at once twelve copies of P.d.S with 1st article. I went to Clifden on Monday to interview Marconi or see station. Could do neither and am waiting reply from Marconi House London. Wrote to Roberts 4 times and at last got enclosed. Have written a letter to Hone calling on him to see that I am acted loyally by. Immediately I hear will write. Call to the pharmacy and see that my letter to P– is forwarded at once. Tell Bartoli I have a lot of news re transatlantic scheme and to see my second article on Aran. I think since I have come so far I had better stay a little longer if possible. Nora’s uncle feeds us in great style and I row and cycle and drive a good deal. I cycled to Oughterard on Sunday and visited the graveyard of The Dead, It is exactly as I imagined it and one of the headstones was to J. Joyce. Do you like 1st article? I send you news of Skeffington and of O.G. Have got a view of Killala for Sordina. Price writes me a letter every day. He has a cure for the foot and mouth disease which is devastating Irish cattle. Styrian oxen suffer from it and are cured but 2000 Irish beasts have been killed. He writes (like you) ‘Be energetic. Drop your lethargy. Forget Leinster for Ulster. Remember that Sir John Blackwood died in the act of putting on his topboots in order to go to Dublin to vote against the Union. You will get your name up if you write this up’. I cannot do so. I have written the whole thing to W. Field M P (pres. of Irish Cattle Traders Society) who of course never answered. I am writing to explain to Price. Do you think he is right or I. I wanted Field who is in the line to take it up not I myself. I think Price ought to look for a cure for the foot and mouth disease of Anna Blackwood Price. Remembrances from all. Write a card to Nora’s uncle. Please look cheerful and write to Jim",
