  "text": "Dear Quinn: I confirm my cable: ‘MS complete, letter follows.’ As I suspected, there is no mistake. The third part consists of: (1) Eumeus (2) Ithaca (3) Penelope Thanks for your draft. It is very kind of you to say you will divide the profits of sale of the Ulysses MS with me. That being so, I can only hope that, as you have decided to dispose of it, your estimate of its probable selling price will prove to be a fraction, and not a large one, of the figure reached. Mr Roche wrote to me about a flat which, like Dublin, was dear and dirty. This kind of life is very trying. I keep on writing but the outlook is not bright. The number of people who are trying to induce themselves or others to produce Exiles is increasing, I see. I am sorry you have so much worrying correspondence about it. Ford has been asking me to give him something for his review, but really I am not ready yet. I am glad you liked your ocean trip. I prefer what a Dublin barrister once called terra cotta.",
