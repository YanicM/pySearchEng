  "text": "Dear Stannie, I received your letter today after two days’ severe gastrical disarrangement consequent on your silence. Tomorrow I will send you 100 crowns to pay your trainfare and 80 crowns (or as much as I can get) of my own: about £8 in all. You are to dress yourself and leave Dublin on receipt of the money, and you are to be in Trieste. You must be in Trieste within ten days. I hope there will be no hitch in the affair now. You can tell Kettle you are going, if you like, and you can sell him any of the songs you like provided he pays you the money for them. Send my novel registered by post. Bring whatever books you want to study for your exam. Buon viaggio! Jim",
