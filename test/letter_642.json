  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: On Saturday night I received a packet from Mrs Harrison containing the rest of the MS of Circe. Her story seems to have been true—luckily for my sanity. Only some pages which she had left on her table have been destroyed. I shall have to go over the notes of the scene again and recreate it which is not so easy as since writing it I wrote the end and all the Eumeus episode and a good part of Ithaca. It is very tiresome but still the packet came as a relief after twentyfour hours of suspense. On receipt of Mr Huebsch’s letter forwarded by you I cabled to Mr Quinn to withdraw the entire typescript of Ulysses…. The next day I arranged for a Paris publication to replace the American one—or rather I accepted a proposal made to me by Shakespeare and Co, a bookseller’s here, at the instance of Mr Larbaud. The proposal is to publish here in October an edition (complete) of the book so made up:",
