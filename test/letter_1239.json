I thought it might be useful or instructive to locate any places mentioned in any Irish songs G. sings. Is this a trick of memory. Now, only this instant, I think I forgot a verse in The Croppy Boy? Did I? How strange memory is! Anyway I write it out. It comes after ‘my mother’s rest’ Tante belle cose Babbo",
