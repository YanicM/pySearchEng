  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Tomorrow I shall send you MS and typescript of the first two watches of Mr Shaun (what I read, slightly revised) and the day after MS and typescript of the rest. There is an interruption near the middle (indicated in the MS). I shall be anxious to hear what you think of it. I don’t know how I managed to do so much with the operation and convalescence and holiday. I hope you will write to me about it. Miss Beach will send you a book of spirit talks with Oscar Wilde which will explain one page of it. He does not like Ulysses. Mrs Travers Smith, the ‘dear lady’ of the book, is a daughter of the late professor Dowden of Trinity College, Dublin. Here is another Borsch dialogue of yesterday. Dr B.: How is our eye? J. J.: Semper idem. Dr B. (business): Not to me. I have still a fortnight. J.J.: Ten days, doctor. You still think you’ll win. Dr B.: Sure I’ll win. J.J.: (baffled, beaten, vanquished, overcome, pulverised) smiles broadly Dr B.: You’ll see all right. J.J.: It is an obstinate eye, doctor, no? Dr B.: No fellow is any good if he’s not obstinate. J.J. (checkmated, silenced, overpowered) smiles broadly: And when do you think you can prescribe for the lenses? Dr B.: Three weeks or a month after. I don’t know what he means. But he ought to be ambassador for the two Americas. I asked him then if the woman from Bordeaux who was operated about the same time would get her sight. She is a bad case, he said, but there is a little hope for her. I ought to tell you a few things. The Irish alphabet (ailm, beith, coll, dair etc) is all made up of names of trees. naṫ (orah) is H. oyin O. Bruno Nolano (of Nola) another great southern Italian was quoted in my first pamphlet The Day of the Rabblement. His philosophy is a kind of dualism—every power in nature must evolve an opposite in order to realise itself and opposition brings reunion etc etc. Tristan on his first visit to Ireland turned his name inside out. The Norwegian-Danish language has neither masculine nor feminine: the two genders are common and neuter. The article follows the noun Manden, hence Landen. Man siger at jeg er blever Konservativ (they say I am still a Tory) is the first line of a poem by Ibsen. The words expressing nightmares are from Greek, German, Irish, Japanese, Italian (my niece’s childish pronunciation) and Assyrian (the stargroup called the ‘gruesome hound’). I speak the latter language very fluently and have several nice volumes of it in the kitchen printed on jampots. Most coastal towns in Ireland (E) are Danish. The poor old fellows were often wreckers. In ancient Dublin there was a ceremony similar to that of the Doge wedding the Adriatic sea. I hope this may help you. You would probably find it out if the piece were in print. It is hard to believe in typescript. I hope you are having good weather up there after the rains and the eclipse. Will you please present my regards to Miss Marsden? I hope I may soon see her book as I heard she was having some research work done here in Paris. Exiles will be given—they say—about the 15 February. The electric light here is going out, I am afraid. I will end this letter. The light goes down, down and then up, up. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
