  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Many thanks for your letters and telegram and also for the draft (£54) safely received. At the next occasion please convey my thanks to my publisher in New York. As regards my play Exiles have you sent the other typescript to him? If not you could send him perhaps a corrected proof or a copy of the play in bookform if it is out. I suppose Mr Sturge Moore of the Stage Society now has a proof of the play and I hope Mr Richards has returned the proof with my MS corrections for Messrs Slack, Monro, Saw and Co. As regards Mr Richards’ printers’ observations I shall write you later on and on the general subject of the rights after the publication of the book. If Mr Richards has told you his decision about Dubliners I should like to know it. If he does not think well of a second edition is it allowed to propose the book to another firm? When Mr Huebsch’s letter arrives I shall be glad to have a copy of A/s [accounts]. If the remittance is in settlement of same they would seem to be rather poor but I need hardly say that in present circumstances I am very glad and grateful to get anything. Allow me in conclusion to wish you the compliments of the season and to thank you for your kind attentions during the past year.",
