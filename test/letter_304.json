Am surprised that no letter has been forwarded from Galway from you. I bought some fine photographs for Sordina and also a copy of Toneâ€™s Autobiography (7/8). I think I did right as he was very kind to me. Am sending them to him. Charlie admits that he lost the post in the telephone through his own fault. Jim",
