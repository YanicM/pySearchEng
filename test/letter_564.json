  "text": "Dear Mr Linati: On account of a sudden illness of his wife, Pound has left for Lake Garda, I think Sirmione. He wrote to me that he would like to have from you for the Dial, an American review, a short article dealing with the new literary movement in Italy. If you agree I will send it there direct (in English) or would you rather see Pound at his Venice address which I gave you before? As the strike is still on there are only one or two bookshops open. Il Convegno is not available and Poesia even less. May I trouble you to send me—cash on delivery—the copy containing my poems? I hope to receive soon the third act of Esuli. The enclosed article by Benco (who is preparing an article on my Ulysses for the Resto del Carlino) may interest you. If you would like to read Tarr I will have a copy sent to you from London.",
