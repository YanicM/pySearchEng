  "text": "Dear Stannie: I return preface typed and amended. If it is all right send it on but do not mention me as I do not want to be made use of. You have not made this point of dialect or lingua clear to an English reader. And I wish it were a little clearer than it is that Schmitz was very careful of his money. Imagine yourself in Manchester reading this preface and you will understand what [I mean.] What have you done with Miss Weaverâ€™s photographs and that of Baroness S. Leger? Sorry to hear you have been ill and hope you are better. Kind regards to Nelly and yourself Jim P.S. Also my relations with S were quite formal. I never crossed the soglia except as a paid teacher and his wife became longsighted when she met Nora in the street.",
