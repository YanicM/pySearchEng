  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I owe you an apology for not having answered before now your letters and hope you will not be angry with me. I am still under doctor’s care and rather depressed that the [eye] attack—possibly on account of the infamous weather—is lasting so long. I never had an attack that lasted so long as this one. I have no pain but the consequences this time seem to be rather serious—but I hope always that an operation may be avoided. I can read and write however and am continuing my book [Ulysses] at the usual snail’s pace. My agent tells me that the Stage Society asked again for my play Exiles and adds that perhaps they will put it on. I owe you an apology also for not having remitted yet the amount of the second dozen copies of my book. I hope to be able to do so tomorrow. There remain also 4 copies to my charge (I think you have forgotten them) and I hope to be able to take later on another 8 copies and will then settle for the third dozen. I received safely all the press notices (English) which you were so kind as to send me and am glad to see that one (The Sphere) mentions your publishing house favourably. As you do not mention sales I suppose they are slow. Perhaps in consequence of the later reviews they will improve. Mr John Quinn is publishing in Vanity Fair (New York, May) an article on the book and he speaks highly of your paper also and of your enterprise in publishing my novel.",
