  "text": "Dear Helen: I hope you had a very pleasant musical birthday, and that you will all have a pleasant crossing. I hired an 8-lamp Philco and Hamm’s man fixed up an antenna on the balcony out of an old walking stick Lucia gave me after we came back from Salzburg. We got the two Italian songs better (very well) but Haendel used [sic, for ‘seemed’] to fade off and come back. One would think on some notes he was in the next room. The voice sounded very pastosa we thought and also easy and extended. A couple of notes (one certainly) were very slightly off tune, at least as heard by me. The diction is a great personal satisfaction to me. I told only the Jolases and the Luxembourg people about it. I did not tell the Turners as she seemed so jaded when I last spoke to her. But today she rang up to ask us to dine on Friday at 7.30! (6.30 pm real time) I am going to say I have to go to the Greek church—perfectly true it is their Good Friday—and can’t get out till 8 at least so I am coming at 8.15 at least. Chialiapine had an imposing funeral. All traffic held up in the centre. Ceremony lasting 5 hours. I was at the Opera when a requiem was sung in the open air with Leon’s two sisters. My wife went to the Russian church. I hope your father is now quite hale and hearty again, also the other members of your family. Give him our congratulations on his rapid and I hope lasting recovery. I believe you are to have a smooth passage as the lune rousse and the tâches au soleil are to finish out in five or six days more, so they tell me. I spent all Easter Day with Lucia, teaching her some Latin, eating panettoni di Milano and fooling generally. More in letter or rather note to Giorgio. I hope Stevie makes good use of the Zeiss glasses on the way back. Arrivederci tutti ben presto e buon viaggio Babbo",
