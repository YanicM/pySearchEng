I think I have placed his niece here and my German publisher writes from the Hague that he is doing all he can about Holland. I hope I can get the others into Ireland. I may go tomorrow to Dieppe for a few days and if so will send a line from there if I do. I donâ€™t think any time should be lost. Many thanks again sincerely yours James Joyce",
