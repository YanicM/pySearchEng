  "text": "Dear Mr Bergan: Can you please let me know whether you received from my Solicitors the cheque (£48.9.9.) for Messrs. Harrison? Also if the inscription has not yet been made I should like to check the wording. It is very good of you to have offered to see this matter through. I do not think you are the last of Pappie’s friends for I know that Mr Devan is still alive. It is strange that after such a long absence I continue to think of all those people, though I have met so many others in different lands. I hear that the little poem I spoke of is published in a New York weekly. I shall ask my agent to send you a copy. Sincerely yours, James Joyce",
