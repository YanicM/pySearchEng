  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am still under the influence of the ‘truthcompelling’ drug, scopolamine (it is used in Germany and U.S.A. to extort bogus confessions from criminals) and my writing seems to me very spidery. But here is some of the news. When I got back here I found the old concierge gone (according to the landlord he was a robber, 15 years servant to a curé who went mad because he found out that his servant had robbed him of 100,000 francs!) but he had left three nice bills on the table. There was also a letter from the Calendar the tenor of which you know. I did not wish to antagonise them on account of Mr Muir’s articles and their attitude. Negotiations went on, they pleaded that they were pledged to publish me etc. In fact even when I had withdrawn the MS telegraphically they sent me a galleyproof with it and said they would say my contribution was ‘postponed’. This would have meant a private circulation of my mutilated piece in proof around London with no profit of publicity or money (Miss Beach says they offered to pay £48 for the piece if published), a blamage with respect to their readers who had been informed in the August and September numbers that a piece of mine would appear, a general impression that I was either half blind or three quarters incapable and a first mild offensive against the fait accompli of Ulysses. I therefore arranged a pleasing epilogue of which you will hear about the middle of next week. The Nouvelle Revue Française is to publish in December, I think, a first instalment of Morel’s translation (they wrote twice asking for it) and the Navire d’Argent (November) will publish an article by Jean Prevost on J.J. and la Presse Française. The German translation of Dedalus is to appear also in November and the publishers have written for photographs and drawings. I cannot make head or tail of Mr Walsh’s review This Quarter. Miss Beach and I have written and wired with reply prepaid but cannot get any answer. Nobody knows where he is or where Shem is. He (Mr Walsh) proposed that Mr Pound correct my proofs. I wrote to Mr Pound assuring him that I wanted nothing better than to check them myself and asking him would it be possible to have my piece set first. E.P.’s reply was a letter to the Chicago Tribune begging all whom it might concern to take note that he had no connection with any review and could not receive any MSS whether in English, American or Javanese…. My eyes are getting better (it was nothing serious) but until Shem and his garrulous mother are settled for life in print I could not rest quiet in Mme de la Vallière’s château, rue Cherche-Midi. None of the operations has been very successful yet but another one inflicted on my troubled mind would be a bad addition. The flat is getting to look well in spite of bills but as yet we have not found a girl. One came, stayed till evensong and then said she had had a telegram telling her to go home. She went and came back at matins saying she had had a second telegram telling her to stay where she was. My wife told her she had had a wireless message telling her to send her back to the place where she was before she came to the place where she was not going to stay….",
