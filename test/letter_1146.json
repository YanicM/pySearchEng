  "text": "Dear Yeats: Many thanks for your letter and the kind words you use. It is now thirty years since you first held out to me your helping hand. Please convey my thanks also to Mr Shaw whom I have never met. I hope that the Academy of Irish Letters (if that is its title) which you are both founding, will have the success it aims at. My case, however, being as it was and probably will be, I see no reason why my name should have arisen at all in connection with such an academy: and I feel quite clearly that I have no right whatsoever to nominate myself as a member of it. I am returning under separate cover the rules you were good enough to send me. I hope your health keeps good. For myself I have to go back to Zurich every three months about my eyes. Still, I work as best I can.",
