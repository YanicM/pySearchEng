In these circumstances we find it quite natural you should stay with him. It would not be very human to do otherwise or for anybody to ask you to do so. I hope the case may not turn out to be so bad as the doctors say. In spite of this care I hope you will pass a pleasant summer there. Kind greetings from us both Babbo",
