  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for your letter of some days ago. I left Paris after a final interview with Dr Borsch. I am to go back there in a couple of months to see the result of the operation and to get other glasses. Meanwhile I am to continue the treatment here or wherever we stop. No further operation, he says, is necessary or would do any good. The sight will come back, he says. I will say nothing more on this subject till then. I left Paris in the usual whirl of confusion. The first fragments of Ulysses translated are to appear in Commerce, a revue de luxe this month. Mr Larbaud being away the fragments chosen were insufficient. I asked to have others added. When this was done the princess di Bassiano objected to some of the passages. This I overruled. (This correspondence must now cease. AUTHOR.) Then the French printer who set Penelope (or part of her) struck out punctuation but put in accents. I insisted on their deletion. This caused fright. In the end, at the suggestion of Miss Monnier or the other two editors Mr Larbaud was telegraphed to. He replied bilingually to make sure there would be no mistake: Joyce a raison Joyce ha ragione. This gem now blazes brightly in my crown. Then Mr Cape and his printers gave me trouble. They set the book with perverted commas and I insisted on their removal by the sergeant-at-arms. Then they underlined passages which they thought undesirable. But as you will see by the enclosed: They were and, behold, they are not. The Neighbourhood Playhouse of New York sent me a contract agreeing to all my terms of last year: advance of $ 250, limit of 1 year or retainer of $500 for another, accounts weekly and stipulation as to production. I have signed and am returning it. I shall have other news of an unusual kind to send you on Monday when I get back a letter which I sent for typing. I prefer to send it than to tell you and I had copies made at once for obvious reasons. All I will say is that it gave me great satisfaction to receive it. I shall defer till then more homely news about this part of the ancient empire of the Celts. I hope you are well in London with this heat. There is a Breton fair on under my windows. I was very glad to get my heels out of Paris in spite of the unsatisfactory result of the operation. It had become almost unbearable especially after the arrival of the teams a week or so ago. I am staying here as it is the best place to look around from and find out where to go. My wife and both my children are with me. They also need a very good rest. The fair is rather noisy (I hope I shall not steal a set of bagpipes from one of the Lower Breton delegates) but perhaps a fall from pandemonium to silence would have stunned me. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
