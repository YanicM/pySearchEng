  "text": "Dear Mr Palmer: The above is my address but you had better write it large and clear, the numeral in Arabic figure not as on your card in Roman as Paris postmen are champions of stupidity. I may mention that I have not received any songs from you since I wrote. Did you send them to me or to MacCormack? In any case send the second lot on to me and I shall redirect them. I hope you have copies and I shall do my best to have them published for you. It is a shame that they are not published already. I am very curious to hear the two additionsâ€”and to sing them. With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
