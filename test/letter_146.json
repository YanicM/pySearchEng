  "text": "Dear Stannie Both the pension and the lessons are off. I have now seven and a half lire. On Thursday at 12 o’c I shall have 0. I don’t know any person in Rome—Wyndham is in Naples and won’t be back for a fortnight yet. There is nothing for it but Artifoni. I couldn’t ask for it in the bank: they wouldn’t give it. If you cannot get it and wire it I don’t know what I can do. It is a pity I cannot get over this month because we are both very well and always hungry. Try and get me out of this hole like a good youth. Artifoni must give you the money: he can easily get it. Jim",
