  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver I thank you for your letter of 17 instant. I have written to Mr Pinker. I have no contract for the book rights of my novel but Mr Grant Richards, publisher, has the right of refusal of it. I believe the greater part of the novel is now in his hands. If the last instalments (May to August) have been set up I should be very much obliged if you could have a proof of them pulled. I am sure that Mr Pound will send them on to Mr Grant Richards. My reason for troubling you is that, in view of Mr Pinker’s offer, I think it is to my advantage to know as soon as possible Mr Grant Richards’ decision. I am glad to hear that The Egoist still appears in spite of these bad times and am sure it will live through them. With kind regards and thanks Sincerely yours James Joyce",
