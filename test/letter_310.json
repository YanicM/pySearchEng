  "text": "My dear Nora I saw Lidwell today and after an hour obtained from him the enclosed letter. I took it to Roberts. Roberts said it was no good and that it should have been addressed to him. I asked Lidwell to write it to Roberts. Lidwell refused and said that I not Roberts was his client. I went to Roberts and told him this. Roberts said that Lidwell should write him a long letter on the whole case saying what I could do, as he could not endanger the firm. I said I would sign an agreement to pay him £60 (sixty pounds) the cost of a 1st edition if the book was seized by the Crown. He said that was no use and asked could I get two securities for £1000 (a thousand pounds) each—in all £2000 (two thousand pounds = 50,000 francs) to indemnify the firm for loss over publishing my book. I said that no person admired me so much as that and in any case it could never be proved that the loss (if any) of the firm was due to my book. He said then that he would act on his solicitor’s advice and not publish the book. I went then into the backroom of the office and sitting at the table, thinking of the book I have written, the child which I have carried for years and years in the womb of the imagination as you carried in your womb the children you love, and of how I had fed it day after day out of my brain and my memory, wrote him the enclosed letter. He said he will send it tonight to his solicitor in London and let me know. I am like a man walking in his sleep. I don’t know what is going on in Trieste. Stannie has not sent me what I asked him for. Eva and Florrie would have nothing to eat but for me. Stannie has sent them nothing and Charlie nothing and me nothing. I don’t know where my desk and table and MSS and books will end. You are away in Galway. I don’t know how we can get back to Trieste or what we shall find there. I don’t know what to do about my diploma or my book. My father says that Roberts will have a new objection even after my letter. The town is beginning to fill and I should like to forget all and be here with you and take you about during the Horse Show. Pover’a me! [sic] This is my holiday. Give my regards to Mr Healy. Tell him I have not a moment to write. Give a kiss to Giorgio and Lucia. I hope you liked the verses. I spoke of you today to my aunt and told her of you—how you sit at the opera with the grey ribbon in your hair, listening to music, and observed by men,—and of many other things (even very intimate things) between us. I told you of my grief at Galway Races. I feel it still. I hope that the day may come when I shall be able to give you the fame of being beside me when I have entered into my Kingdom. Be happy, dear, and eat and sleep. You can sleep now. Your tormentor is away Jim Enclosure to above letter",
