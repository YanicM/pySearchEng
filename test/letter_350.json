I have now sent on to Mr John Jaff√© the fourth and also the fifth (and last) chapters of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. I hope you will receive them safely. It is very kind of you to take so much trouble in the matter. Any letter forwarded to me should be in Italian or German and preferably in open envelope and quite formal. I hope I shall remain at liberty. Till now the Austrian authorities have not interfered with me in any way. Allow me to thank you once again for your kindness and to beg you also to give my kind regards to Mr Pound.",
