  "text": "My true love Your present is lying before me on the table as I write, ready. I will now describe it to you. It is a flat square case of brown leather with two narrow golden borders. When you press a spring it opens and the case itself inside is cushioned with soft orange-coloured silk. A small square card lies in the case and on the card there is written in golden ink the name Nora and under that the dates 1904â€“1909. Under the card is the ornament itself. There are five little cubes like dice (one for each of the five years we have been away) made of yellowish ivory which is more than a hundred years old. These are drilled through and strung together on a thin gold fetter chain the links of which are like small safety pins so that the whole string forms a necklet and the clasp is at the back beside the middle dice. In the centre of the chain in the front and forming part of the chain itself (not hanging from it like a pendant) there is a small tablet also of yellowish ivory which is drilled through like the dice and is about the size of a small domino piece. This tablet has on both sides an inscription and the letters are engraved into it. The letters themselves were selected from an old book of types and are in the fourteenth century style and very beautiful and ornamental. There are three words engraved on the face of the tablet, two above and one underneath, and on the reverse of the tablet there are four words engraved, two above and two below. The inscription (when both sides are read) is the last line of one of the early songs in my book of verses, one which has also been set to music: and the line is therefore engraved three words on the face and four on the back. On the face the words are Love is unhappy and the words on the back are When Love is away. The five dice mean the five years of trial and misunderstanding, and the tablet which unites the chain tells of the strange sadness we felt and our suffering when we were divided. That is my present, Nora. I thought over it a long time and saw every part of it done to my liking. Save me, my true love! Save me from the badness of the world and of my own heart! Jim",
