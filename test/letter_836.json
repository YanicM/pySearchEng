This is my best writing—already a progress. One operation today at 5.30 and the last (I hope) on Tuesday next. Enclosed is 150 francs. I would like to have these as soon as you can. Perhaps you could ’phone the people if place out of your way. What about the proofs and my silly idea? Best Easter greetings from us all.
