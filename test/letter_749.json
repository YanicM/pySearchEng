  "text": "Dear Eliot: We left London on Thursday and here we are (homeless, ragged and tanned) running about in taxis, looking for a flat. I was very sorry our picnic was put off. I hope Mrs Eliot is now definitely better. Please give her our best wishes. The right treatment, in my case, at least, was found it seems after a disastrous series of wrong diagnosis and wrong treatment. I shall let you know when we get some way settled. I expect I shall soon be in London again as I have a great deal to do there still. I enjoyed my visit very much. With renewed good wishes sincerely yours James Joyce",
