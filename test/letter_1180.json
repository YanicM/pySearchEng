  "text": "Dear Stannie: Thanks for your wire of felicitations. Broken-backed Britain next. Who are the enclosed? If you know them say I got the letter after a 2 months’ circular tour of all my former addresses in Europe. Now touching Xmas, as poor Pappie used to begin. Can you come here for the week. What does for four, girl included, can do for six. You ought to get a ribasso on the rlwy. Besides you can see Stevie. Also Sullivan if he’s back from Marseilles. We all hope you can come. Lucia is much better (touching wood) in excellent health but as stramba as a March hare and as proud as ever she can be. But devil a hapworth else that I can see after her ten doctors. Anyhow send me a word by wire. Nora has made 4 plum puddings so there’s enough to go round. I would like you to hear Giorgio’s voice. He ought to come out next year. I got Lucia to study singing after 8 years’ of talking. Don’t talk to her either about dancing or diseases. She is beginning to forget about both, thank the Lord. Ulysses will come out in N.Y. on 15 January next. Send me the wire anyway and I hope you can arrange it. Jim Santa Lucia ’33 Her candle is burning quietly in the drawing room. She has had rather a job looking after my occhi.",
