  "text": "Dear Mr Goyert: I have not yet seen the German Ulysses, I do not like at all the title So Sind Sie in Dublin, It is not my point of view which would be, if at all, ‘So Sind Wir in Dublin.’ But I like neither. If ‘Dubliners’ is impossible what about ‘In Dublin Stadt’ or ‘Dublin an der Liffey’? Please let me know by return Sincerely yours James Joyce",
