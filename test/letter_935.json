  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am glad you got the booklet and did not dislike it. None of the others (Symons, Yeats, Pound, my father, brother etc) to whom I sent copies even acknowledged receipt of it. I expect Slocombe’s notice in the Herald will be the last as it was the first. Miss Beach and Miss Monnier have gone to Savoy. I did not change lawyer because a) it was nearly impossible to find one to act b) he is the most influential American in Paris except the ambassador c) all the dossier is in his office in New York d) his first act when Miss Beach retired was to send her his bill for services in her mother’s case e) I am not sure that I know all the facts of the case or that Miss Beach does e) [sic] his letter was so callous in any case that I thought it better not to antagonise him. Her father and sister arrive here in August. What the result will be I do not know. It is now proposed that Miss Monnier is not to do successive editions of Ulysse. I understand that the N.R.F. will do them, if needed. She will do a limited semi-private edition, I think. More kilos of abuse about K. Mr Shane Bullock calls me a monster and Mr Ben Hecht a Jack the Ripper. The review has received letters from former friendly critics, Edwin Muir, [sic] deploring my collapse. I am working night and day at a piece I have to insert between the last and Z. It must be ready by Friday evening. I never worked against time before. It is very racking. This house is shuttered up, ten out of twelve flats being left by absent families. I wish I saw some prospect of air and rest and relief from the storms and stifling heaviness but I see none. I enclose an explanation of one of the added phrases on p. 1 of last instalment. Two of your guesses were fairly near the last is off the track. The piece I am hammering at ought to reveal it. Please excuse this but I have Friday on the brain. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce [Enclosure] L’Arcs en His Cieling Flee Chinx on the Flur. 1) God’s in his heaven All’s Right with the World 2) The Rainbow is in the sky (arc-en-ciel) the Chinese (Chinks) live tranquilly on the Chinese meadowplane (China alone almost of the old continents] has no record of a Deluge. Flur in this sense is German. It suggests also Flut (flood) and Fluss (river) and could even be used poetically for the expanse of a waterflood. Flee = free) 3) The ceiling of his T house is in ruins for you can see the birds flying and the floor is full of cracks which you had better avoid 4) There is merriment above (larks) why should there not be high jinks below stairs? 5) The electric lamps of the gin palace are lit and the boss Roderick Rex is standing free drinks to all on the ‘flure of the house’ 6) He is a bit gone in the upper storey, poor jink. Let him lie as he is (Shem, Ham and Japhet) 7) The birds (doves and ravens) (cf the jinnies is a cooin her hair and the jinnies is a ravin her hair) he saved escape from his waterhouse and leave the zooless patriark alone.",
