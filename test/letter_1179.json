  "text": "Dear Eliot: No, I had heard nothing at all though one of your replies at lunch struck me. As you wrote me through your office I prefer to wait till I see you over here again to allude to the matter. Thanks for writing to me. One needs a huge lot of patience in these cases. It is I who should excuse myself. I forgot you were not there for all night. Anyhow Léon and I stayed on a long time after with the patronne, L. explaining to her all about Ulysses (which he has not yet read!). Sullivan is still in the midi so I have not gone to Zurich. Let me know when you come over next—but in advance. And also excuse my delay in replying. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
