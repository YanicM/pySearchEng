  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver…. Miss Monnier gave a big dinner in my honour to hear the radio. London was put on at 8.30 sharp. Nicholson announced at once that pressure had been brought to bear on him etc etc and that the expected talk on J.J. could not take place. The company expressed itself volubly in French about the B.B.C. directors etc after which we all went in to table and had a merry meal…. I am working very hard. Everything seems now to be well disposed. It is strange that my presence has this effect and my absence produces a violent reaction. For instance, there has appeared in the Catholic World (N.Y.) an article—leader—on me which Colum and his wife say is so vulgar and scurrilous that they will not show it to me. They are both indignant over it. Guess who the writer is. Michael Lennon who helped me so much in the Sullivan affair, who asked me for a signed copy of Ulysses, whom I invited to Llandudno, whom I entertained with Hughes to dinner and talked with till 1 a.m., who afterwards wrote asking me if I would allow his wife to call on me on her way through Paris etc. Pourquoi? With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
