The accompanying copy of the Dublin Times ought to interest you. I am sure that if you care to write personally to Dr T.J. Kiernan, director of Broadcasting at Radio Eireann [sic], G.P.O. Dublin and tell him who are you he will get into touch with these musicians and obtain the words and air of that fine old song for you. I have been trying vainly, as you know, to get them for about 40 years. Dr Kiernan knows me. In fact he arranged a broadcast about me for my birthday this year. I am still on night and day labour sincerely yours James Joyce",
