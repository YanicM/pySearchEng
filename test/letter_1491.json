  "text": "Dear Mrs Sax: Many thanks for having so promptly sent all the numbers of Prospettive I asked for. The photograph of the minister is rather amusing and shows that he must have a sense of humour. So much the better. When he was governor of Rome some years ago he invited me to be present as a guest at some literary function there. I can’t remember exactly. I wrote thanking for the honour implied but declining. With my poor sight and general insipidity I am out of place at such reunions. I wonder whether my poor Anna Livia gave Mr Sax and you a headache also? As I said it is hard to remit money anywhere at present. So, as I suggested, I am sending you a book about Rome. It was written by my friend Valery Larbaud and I hope you will like it with its purple and yellow sack. I would ask him to sign it but the poor man is paralyzed on the right side and cannot use his right hand. He lives here where there is a street named after him or perhaps it is after the source or sources of the family. I also received an envelope from you but there was nothing in it. So either you forgot to put the letter in [or] it got out en route. We came here for a few weeks. My family troubles are just as they were. We hope your sister’s condition is still not unfavourable. My daughter-in-law is reported to be slightly better but I am afraid the damage done cannot be remedied. I am still trying to bring Lucia (my daughter) to a place near here so that we may not be so scattered. But nothing is easy now. With renewed thanks and our friendly greetings to you both sincerely yours James Joyce",
