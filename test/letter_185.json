  "text": "Dear Stannie, Nothing happened. I understood that A. promised me I could go back whenever I liked; otherwise I should not have given notice. Kindly state in what condition the school is. Could I not return to Trieste and give private lessons? It is a pleasant state of mind to be in. I suppose I have made a coglioneria. You may imagine the state of my nerves. Who knows how this will end. For my part I have one life. I have felt lately that is slipping from me ‘like water from a muslin bag’. Coppinger is a ‘Merrion Square Surgeon’. Synge is a storm centre: but I have done nothing. John Long has not answered me. I wrote him an insolent letter today: so I suppose I will never see the MS of Dubliners again. I would like to be in Trieste again not for the sake of the school but because I should sometimes have opportunity of meeting somebody who shared to a certain extent, my temperament. I am fond of Georgie, of course, but I fear (funny, just as I wrote the word two Americans ejaculated it opposite me) I fear that my spiritual barque is on the rocks. There is some element of sanity in this last mad performance of mine, I am sure. I feel somehow that I am what Pappie said I wasn’t a gentleman. But that is balls, as Rudolph Ellwood would say. Anyway I am a fish out of water. I would like to go back to Trieste because I remember some nights walking along the streets in the summer and thinking over some of the phrases in my stories. I have just been listening to Americans discussing Giordano Bruno in honour of whom there is a procession here tomorrow. They seem to know something of him but I dislike the accent. I will write you more fully on receipt of your letter. At present, I am too disturbed to write a long letter. Your coglionato brother Jim",
