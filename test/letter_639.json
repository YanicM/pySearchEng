  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: … I have at least one item of news which is not bad. A few days ago I received a most enthusiastic letter from Mr Valery Larbaud the French translator of Samuel Butler and also a novelist saying that he is ‘raving mad’ over Ulysses which, he is kind enough to say, is as ‘great and comprehensive and human as Rabelais’. He says that he has been unable to write or sleep since he read it and he proposes to translate some pages of it with an article in the Nouvelle Revue Française. I hope he will not change his mind. With kind regard sincerely yours James Joyce",
