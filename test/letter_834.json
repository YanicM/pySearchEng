I want to give you some MS next week if I am better· but I am not well enough yet—the MS I told you of. I enclose 100 frs as part of my debt with very many apologies. Please let me know if you are still free for next week, I hope. Please write with a heavy black pencil. I cannot distinguish one word of print or pen but can pencil with a magnifying glass Apologising for this dreadful letter Sincerely yours James Joyce",
