  "text": "Dear Yeats: It was very kind of you to send me the signed copy of your collected poems. I appreciate it very much for, though I have many friendly letters of yours, I have had no signed book of yours till now. As a small return will you please accept a little book I am sending you, also signed, a fragment of a book I am writing, published in Holland not long ago? The cover design is by my daughter. I hope this letter and the book (for greater safety I am sending it, registered, through the Galignani Library here) will reach you safely at the only address I can find, that in Whoâ€™s Who 1935. It seems that the other books I sent went astray and probably also the telegram sent you on your seventieth birthday, sent to your former address in Merrion Square. With many good wishes sincerely yours James Joyce",
