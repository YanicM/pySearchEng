  "text": "Dear Gogarty: I sent you back the budget. I am still alive. Here is a more reasonable request. I am singing at a garden fête on Friday and if you have a decent suit to spare or a cricket shirt send it or them. I am trying to get an engagement in the Kingstown Pavilion. Do you know anyone there? My idea for July and August is this—to get Dolmetsch to make me a lute and to coast the south of England from Falmouth to Margate singing old English songs. When are you leaving Oxford? I wish I could see it. I don’t understand your allusion. Chamber Music is the title for the suite. I suppose Jenny is leaving in a day or so. I shall call to say farewell and adieu. Her letter did not annoy me. The others did. I enclose one lest you should plume yourself. Ellwood is nearly cured. I have a rendezvous with Annie Langton. But you forget her? I have no news to report. Their Intensities and Their Bullockships continue to flourish. His Particular Intensity walks now unencumbered. Headley [?] is going for Greenwood Pim’s job in C P I—desires to be remembered to you. You will not have me faithfully. Adieu then, Inconsequent. Stephen Daedalus",
