  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I hardly know what to write. Dr Borsch tells me the eye is clearing slowly and that it takes a certain time but that it is sure, if slow. I suppose he is right but the improvement which he perceives I cannot see or see very slightly as it is still a long way from reading vision…. As for the dentist he is equally optimistic and has even begun to test me for the permanent plate. I know that both these doctors are the best in their branches in Paris and are very conscientious and so all I can do is to assent. But I wish it were all over…. The weather here ever since my operations has been dreadful. Nevertheless I have gone through some of my notes with what sight I have. I will end this now and send it off. It is thundering and my daughter is playing the piano. She has made good progress. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. I think this is the anniversary of my eye attack.",
