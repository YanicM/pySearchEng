I asked my pupil twice if he knew anyone who would take lessons but he knew no-one. I suppose you will get this on Tuesday and if it was out of your power to send something yesterday could you possibly telegraph something. I have 10 lire left. If I receive nothing from you I have no means of getting any, I can’t do miracles. And not a word from that cursed son of a bitch in London. Jim Nora and Georgie have had their meals all right.",
