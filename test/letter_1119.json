  "text": "Dear Mr Huntington I do not think I can usefully add anything to what my learned friend, the professor of English at the University of Trieste (see titlepage) has written in his preface to Senilita, (As) A man grows older. With regard to the other book by the author of Senilità the only things I can suggest as likely to attract the British reading public are a preface by sir J.M. Barrie, author of My Lady Nicotine, opinions of the book (to be printed on the back of its jacket) from two deservedly popular personalities of the present day, such as, the rector of Stiffkey and the Princess of Wales and (on the front of the jacket) a coloured picture by a Royal Academician representing two young ladies, one fair and the other dark but both distinctly nicelooking, seated in a graceful though of course not unbecoming posture at a table on which a book stands upright, with title visible and underneath the picture three lines of simple dialogue, for example: Ethel: Does Cyril spend too much on cigarettes! Doris: Far too much. Ethel: So did Percy (points)—till I gave him ZENO. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
