  "text": "Dear Stannie, Last night a man came to take lessons from me and I asked him to pay in advance. He gave me 20 Lire so that with economy I can live until Monday morning. I had given up all idea of the advt as two days had intervened. He wants 30 lessons. I said I would give them for Lire 50 and he agreed: so that he owes me Lire 30. But, of course, I cannot know when he will pay. It was certainly providential. This is the second advt I answered in the Tribuna. The first got me the position in the bank: the second a providential pupil. He takes lessons every evening. I get out of the bank usually about 7.30 or 7.45: sometimes later. Then I have his lesson from 8 to 9 so that for this month my timetable is rather full. But I don’t care so long as I can get to the 30th safely. I expect you will be able to raise something for me today and then this fellow may give me the other 30 Lire soon. As for the trousers remember that I am sitting for 9½ hours daily on an uncushioned, straw-bottomed chair and the stuff was always thin. Anyway the fact remains that I have two great patches on the seat and have to wear my ‘tail-coat’ constantly. Not a word or sign from Grant Richards. I will wait till Sunday and then write to him again. The reason I sent you Avanti was that it contained an article either of Lombroso or of Gorki. Maybe I sent you the wrong copy. I also sent you a copy of L’Asino. As soon as I have a little money in my pocket I shall send you The Lake. You seem to be annoyed about Kettle. The reason I was not interested is because I take no interest in parliamentarianism as I suppose, you know. However, I have asked Aunt J— to send me a copy of The Nationist—if it still exists. As for a possible friendship with Kettle it seems to me my influence on male friends is provocative. They find it hard to understand me, and difficult to get on with me even when they seem well-equipped for these tasks. On the other hand two ill-equipped women, to wit, Aunt Josephine and Nora, seem to be able to get at my point of view, and if they do not get on with me as well as they might they certainly manage to preserve a certain loyalty which is very commendable and pleasing. Of course I am not speaking of you. On all subjects—except socialism (for which you care nothing) and painting (of which I know nothing)—we have the same or like opinions. I have never doubted that you have a talent for the latter art. But an appreciable change in our fortunes is necessary before you can develop it. It is too early to despair of such a change. Lately I found I was wishing myself at a seaside place in England or Ireland: rashers and eggs in the morning, the English variety of sunshine, a beefsteak with boiled potatoes and onions, a pier at night or a beach and cigarettes. By the way I forgot to tell you about the pension. One man wanted Lire 150 a month for only lunch and dinner for Nora and myself, exclusive of breakfast or supper. Lire 50 goes for my room, candles and washing so that I would have just 50 Lire left for clothing for three people and—eventualities. Enclosed please find article by Ibsen—or rather excerpt. I have just received your remittance which will be wonderfully useful to me. I send you The Lake, send me your opinion of it. This morning in the bank that German clerk informed us what his wife should be: she should be able to cook well, to sew, to housekeep, and to play at least one musical instrument. I suppose they’re all like that in Deutschland. I know it’s very hard on me to listen to that kind of talk. Besides that, he is always teaching the other (ignorant) Italian clerk (and me) Latin and philosophy. He has been to some university where, he says, der Professer [sic] ‘lectured’ in Latin: and all the studenten spoke Latin. Greek too. Even the atmosphere of the BS was better than this. However— I don’t quite agree with you about the U.I. In my opinion, it is the only newspaper of any pretensions in Ireland. I believe that its policy would benefit Ireland very much. Of course so far as any intellectual interest is concerned it is hopelessly deaf. But even that deafness is preferable to the alertness of Dialogues of the Day. A clerk in this office has just come back, without one finger, after four weeks’ sick leave. His face is studded with pimples and he has a pen behind his ear. Here is the German. They shake hands and laugh. Every one looks at the fingerless clerk with astonishment. He is very ugly, a Swiss, and has a voice like a rusty saw. Here is another Italian clerk: who says: O, long life, here you are. Même jeu (as G.M. would say). Two phrases in Italian madden me. One is: di’ un po’ (I say). Every clerk who wanders in here from another writing-box comes in with a sodden preoccupied air, goes over to some colleague and murmurs di’ un po’: and then halts to remember what he has to say. The other phrase is Signore. Every wretched scribbler, every—but why make a catalogue?—is a signore if he works with a pen or employs an assistant. Canarutto told me his cousin, your landlord, was (with many a significant nod) a signore. But yet, you seem unable to share my detestation of the stupid, dishonest, tyrannical and cowardly burgher class. The people are brutalised and cunning. But at least they are capable of some honesty in these countries: or, at least, they will move because it is their interest to do so. I am a stranger to them, and a prey for them often: but, in the sense of the word as I use it now, I am not an enemy of the people. Many thanks for your prompt reply and await your letter. Jim",
