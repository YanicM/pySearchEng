  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have been laid up for about ten days with a lamentable sort of cold, a dreary thing of which Paris is full. I hope you have better air up there. Now I am better but still rheumy. I hope you got the Revue Nouvelle. The Hades episode translated by Morel is to appear in the December N.R.F. Two days ago the proof of Z arrived from Como. I corrected it, rubbed on more boot polish and sent it back express. I hope it comes out in a week or so. I ought to go into the clinic then, ought I not? I send you some advance press opinions of U My father: He has gone off his head, I am afraid. He has overworked himself. Why did he not go to the bar? He speaks better than he writes. My brother Charles: Received. Off to Carlow for a few days. My brother Stanislaus: What are you driving at? To make the English language quite incomprehensible. Literary bolshevism. Too flabby for my taste. Arthur Power: Always glad to receive anything. Could you place enclosed MSS with your agent? Laubenstein: No acknowledgment. E.P.: F.M.F.: E.W.: idem. Claudel (Paul): I thought I knew English until I read it. Mrs Wallace: I donâ€™t understand a single word. What is it about? Wallace: I remembered parts I had heard from you. Huddleston: Why would the English printer not print it? I am working at Yd still. In a few days, Saturday, I think, the men will have finished here. They brought some furniture for the diningroom and took it back a few days after to stuff it! I never do that when I supply prose to the public. All stuffing done on the premises. With kindest regards from a bronchially impeded author.",
