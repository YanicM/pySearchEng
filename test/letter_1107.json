  "text": "Dear Eliot: I asked Léon to send you the news. My daughter-in-law’s brother, a N.Y. stockbroker, is bringing me a personal offer for the U.S. publication of Ulysses on the 21 instant from a friend of his, Mr Bennett Serf [sic] who has two books of mine in his Modern Library which he took away from the helpless Huebsch. I am at present owner of all the rights of Ulysses. I send you an article which has just come out in Le Correspondant which, as you probably know, is the oldest review in France. I never met Mr Rops. Gillet says the next thing will be a long laudation in Etudes. The Fortnightly, on the other hand, has an article on W i P by Gilbert (paid for also) for the last 25 months. I suppose they have board meetings about it 52 times a year. Can you throw any light on this other problem. It is said here that Ulysses, though banned for sale in England, is on the programme for some Cambridge examinations and that the professors lend copies to the students. I hope Mrs Eliot and yourself are well. I am somewhat better and am trying to get on with my work.",
