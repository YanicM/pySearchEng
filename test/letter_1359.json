  "text": "Dear Mr Hertz: Will you please fill in the address on the enclosed letter for me (I don’t know it) and forward it to Helen’s father? Many thanks. We are here but perhaps we shall leave for France on tomorrow or on Wednesday. We did not care to ring you up yesterday it being your first Sunday at home since you got back from holidays. Of course we should be delighted to see you but I fancy only your weekends are free. There is something which I am very curious to find out. Have you a doctor in St Gallen or anybody else who knows the doctors (Binswamer etc) in the Kreuzlingen Sanatorium (about 30 Km off) where the famous Russian dancer Nijinsky has been for the past 18 years, He was supposed to be an absolutely hopeless case of dementia praecox and yet according to sensational reports a week ago in the press he is now miraculously cured as a result of insulin treatment. My reason for being curious is that only a fortnight ago it was proposed to me in Paris to submit Lucia to this identical treatment. There is no doubt about it that she is better as a result of glandular treatment during the past 18 months and I shall hesitate to have recourse to any more drastic method. Still since I am here on the spot I should very much like to know if this cure is authentic. If it is I believe it will or ought to revolutionise the treatment of mental-moral maladies which are also clearly physical. Our friendly regards to Mrs Herz and yourself sincerely yours James Joyce",
