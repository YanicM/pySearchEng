  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for your letter and enclosures. I know the Bulletin well. Do you know the exact address as I should [like] to send a word of thanks. How is it that your [presscutting] agency never includes Irish notices? A consequence of the Free State Act? I am waiting for the proofs of Z and U. Many thanks also for the unbreakable script which I may use. As regards the article in the R. de D.M. I have been planning that for three years. I tried first the Revue de Paris, then the Revue de France. It does not matter as the R. de D.M. is even better. The tone of the article does not matter much. M. Gillet is a son-in-law of M. René Doumic. He suppresses the fact of my having resurrected M. Dujardin which is unfair but everyone knows it. I think it remarkable that attacks have not been more frequent and bitter. Miss Téry really ought not to have compared my optic to that of Elohim Adonai. I now intend to arrange an article of lower criticism, if possible, a textual analysis of either Eolus, Sirens or Cyclops. After that an illustrated and intelligent caricature and then the book may look after itself as best it can. I know that Yd ought to be about roads, all about dawn and roads, and go along repeating that to myself all day as I stumble along the roads hoping it will dawn on me how to show up them roads so as everybody’ll know as how roads etc. There was a terrible standup battle here (words and gestures) and the landlord turned all the English guests out of the hotel (I acted as spokesman for them as they could not speak French). It was illegal, the police said, but they thought it better to go. He will ruin his hotel but he does not care. In the middle of the hullabaloo he turned round on me and, with a deep bow, said he had the greatest respect for the ‘illustre écrivain and savant and—homme du monde!’—and that his words were not for me (je répète, etc). My exquisite voice was heard pouring out exquisite oleaginous phrases (Oui, Monsieur, mais permettez-moi—Parfaitement, Monsieur, pour vous j’ai le plus grand) but in the end he bowed and marched out of what he called ‘cet aréopage’. They’re all gone now but I don’t like overmuch my pedestal. He will never rival H.C.E. and, on that subject, liffle Anna countrymouse keeps me awake half the night. I hope this may amuse you. Did you get the I.S. and Corriere I sent you through Miss Beach. I hope you will instruct someone to book for the concert. You will not find seats fortyeight hours after the announcement of it.",
