  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards I enclose copy of a letter which was sent to me c/o Egoist office. I have replied to say that my novel is at present under consideration by you. I presume the complete copy of the book is now in your possession and trust you will write to me as soon as you have read it through. I have also received a letter from the editor of the Smart Set (New York). He informs me that his paper bought two of my stories and printed them and would have printed more ‘if there had been more time before the publication of the American edition of the book’. From this I gather that you have ceded magazine rights for America of some of the stories and that an American edition of the book is published. The editor of the Smart Set wishes to print something else of mine. I replied referring him to Mr Ezra Pound or to the editor of The Egoist in case he desires to take on the serial publication of my novel, pending its English and American publication in book form. I shall be glad to hear from you on these points and also to read any other notices you may have received. I am still well and unmolested in any way but would ask you to address letters as above. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
