  "text": "Dear Mr Brody; We came back the day before yesterday—Lord knows for how long! Many thanks for your kind letter which I have forwarded to Mr Brauchbar. I have just received the enclosed letter from Dr Goyert in which he asks about you. Will you please send it back as I wish to reply to it. I should like to see the articles he speaks of but have no idea how or where they can be obtained. We stayed in La Baule a week. I chose it because the Maison de Santé at Ivry (near Paris, 6 K) where unfortunately my daughter still is had made all arrangements with the military government here to evacuate their premises en masse (105 patients and 60 staff) and transfer to the Hotel Edelweiss, La Baule, a big, disused hotel on the Avenue de Paris in a park. We passed a very anxious time. Bid you ever see her illuminated work in Chaucer’s A B C—a poem to the Madonna with a preface by Louis Gillet? It is very kind of you to take such trouble for my friend. I have had a more or less favorable reply from Dublin and think I can place two more of his Abrahamesque family there. We spent a whole month in the Hague, my wife, my daughter and myself in the happy years gone by, Hotel Victoria, I think. The best potatoes I ever ate since I left Ireland. I have come back to put the finishing touches to Work in Progress and in what an atmosphere! Friendly greetings from my wife also to Mrs Brody and yourself sincerely yours James Joyce",
