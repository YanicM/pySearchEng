It seems I have to undergo some kind of a supplementary operation still (big or small, I don’t know). Is it not a frightful bore? I hope you are well. If all goes well I hope Mrs Nebbia and yourself will come to dinner here soon before they throw us out next month—but you not like [sic] a meal presided over by a cyclops? Thanks for the N.R.F. It removes all the breadcrumbs very neatly, I think. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
