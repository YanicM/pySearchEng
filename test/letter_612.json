  "text": "Dear Budgen: Couldn’t find a flat in all Paris and here we are in a private hotel. Damnably dear but I must finish Circe. Am making the final draft. How are you? Everyone here coughing his or her guts up. Have you been working? Your account in [of?] London is very nice—like Sargent’s. I have not heard from him lately. I enclose 5 francs. Can you please through any newsagent procure for me a copy of News of World and Reynold’s News for 29 May and 5 June of this year? There is hell in New York about Nausikaa. Review seized and editor committed for trial at next session, bailed out by Quinn. Quinn and Pound want me to withdraw the book from the review so as to safeguard the private edition, but it is as broad as it is long. Have you met Pound? Write me a line or two. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Did you see that Fleiner’s friend Spitteler got the Nobel prize?",
