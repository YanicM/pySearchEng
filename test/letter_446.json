  "text": "Dear Sir: I hope you will excuse my delay in answering your letter and also the brevity of this reply. I am recovering from a very long and tiresome illness of the eyes (rheumatic iritis complicated with synechia and glaucoma). Your very kind letter gave me much pleasure and I should deem it a privilege to have a copy of your novel Following Darknessâ€”in return for which I should like to send you perhaps my verses if you have not already a copy. I suppose you know that according to present regulations books are forwarded to neutral countries only when dispatched by agents or booksellers authorised to forward them. I trust you will have good success with your writings and I shall write to you later if you will allow me to do so. With many thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
