  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for that passage about the rivers. The coincidence you mention about the Dane is strange but I am well used to these things. Here is another. I mentioned to you a Dublin nabob who fed his guests when Lord Mayor off golden plates, sir Benjamin Lee Guinness of the brewery, Dublin’s Noah. He restored S. Patrick’s cathedral too. He had two sons, lord Ardilaun afterwards and lord Iveagh. My father unseated the former for Dublin city. No conservative was ever returned after. The elder brother … was morose and charitable. The younger brother Cecil … married another Guinness as his father did before him. I suppose you see the map as I do. I cannot find anything at present about Noah’s wife (the medieval figure of the mystery plays is one of the models for Anna Livia) Elizabeth, afterwards Lady Guinness, but thinking of the subject I wondered what the Irish word for Guinness’s vineyard’s beverage would be. It is lin dub or dub lin. I report two dialogues Dr Borsch. How are you? J.J. Slightly inclined to pessimism. Dr Borsch. You don’t think etc. J.J. Well … Dr B. What will you bet? J.J. Fixing a date. Dr B. A month. How much will you bet? J.J. O well…. (later) J.J. You removed the front wall of the capsule and the lens.? Dr B. Yes J.J. Can a cataract form on the back wall? Dr B. Sure. J.J. Is it likely in my case? Dr B. No. If it did I’d win my bet quicker. J.J. (prolonged smile) He beats me easily every time. He ought to have written Ulysses. I am in a great hurry to post this tonight and have been writing, writing all day for the past week. The weather here is terrible. I hope you have better. I will soon send you the rest of Shaun—if the post accepts his bulk.",
