  "text": "Dear Mr. Gorman: As we did not meet in Bologne [sic], much to my regret, I am sending you some rectifications for your book about me, which I hope will reach you in time for the English edition. You may incorporate them in the text or in footnotes, or in an appendix, but I should prefer you to do so as though the information, which deals with facts only, had been acquired by you in a personal conversation, and not as contributed by me. I send you a copy of the Navire d’Argent, which I hope reached you safely and shall forward you in the next week or so, a copy of This Quarter containing another piece. As since the death of Mr. John Quinn, I have no agents in America, I should be very glad if you could give me any information concerning a quarterly review entitled ‘Two Worlds’ edited by Mr. Samuel Roth. I look forward to the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Groman [sic] and yourself in Paris at an early date. Sincerely yours, James Joyce",
