  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I thank you for your letter of 5 inst. Dubliners: The royalty account has not yet arrived. Exiles: I am writing to Mr Archer asking him whether he can help you in any way. Mr Yeats wrote me that he would take on the play but for the fact that at present his company is scattered. Mr Pound has written an article about it in Drama (Chicago): a review which may publish it later: but he adds that he considers it almost impossible for the English stage and advises me to try continental theatres. Will you kindly have the typewritten copy made at once and sent me here by registered post, act by act as it is finished? I need it and hope this can be done quickly. A Portrait of the Artist: While Messrs Duckworth are considering this it would be well, I think, to try some such scheme as I suggested. I wrote this morning to Mr Symons, explaining the case and asking for his advice. If he writes to you for the typescript you can send it to him as soon as it is sent back to you. Verses: I shall send you tomorrow two little pieces of verse which you may send to the Saturday Review or any other paper which will print them and pay well and quickly.",
