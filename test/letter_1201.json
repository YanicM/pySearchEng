  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Will you please send back the enclosed when read. I don’t know what to do about the lettrines. I have now lost the Xmas market for the book. They meant months of work, 3 at least, apart from their value. What a softheaded idiot! If any notice of my fragment appeared in the English press in which Lucia’s name is mentioned will you please send it to me. The Dutch firm was willing to do the Chaucer poem without any money from my side. We came here a day or two ago to allow a brigade of workmen time to set in order, clean, paint etc a flat which had been occupied for 20 years by the same people and to allow my wife time and space to repair her very exhausted nervous system. This place (my choice) is easily the most charming one of its kind we have ever seen but the weather is not good and, worst of all, the newsboys keep careering round the streets shouting out about ‘l’Autriche’. I am afraid poor Mr Hitler-Missler will soon have few admirers in Europe apart from your nieces and my nephews, Masters W. Lewis and E. Pound. My wife is making a cure of baths which, I think, will do her good. Did Léon send you a bundle of MS? Indispensable for the Xmas fire. I am still on the watch for news from the U.S. courts. I fancy they will rise on the 31 instant for the long vacation. I think the delay is a good sign. I read of the usual terrible thunderstorms in England this summer. Thank Jupiter, we have escaped so far. I have been working very hard and hope to get on quickly once I am in dock again. I suppose you are as usual superior to weather conditions and in the goodest of health. With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
