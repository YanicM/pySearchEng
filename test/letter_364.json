  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards I have received your letter of 29 April with statement of sales up to 31 December by which I see that 379 copies of Dubliners were sold in the United Kingdom. I was sorry that neither you nor I have gained anything. In your statement I see no mention of the 120 copies which I bought: I believe I owe you some small amount still which I could not remit owing to the outbreak of war. There is no mention also of the stories which the editor of the Smart Set appears to have bought. In any case these trifling sums would not change the position which is disastrous for both so far as I can see. I have appointed Mr Pinker my literary agent so that you deal with him directly. I live too far away to be able to conduct my own affairs, such as they are. I beg you not to omit to return the fifth chapter of my novel to the editor of The Egoist before the 20 May as the paper needs it for the June issue. You can let Mr Pinker know your decision perhaps at the same time. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
