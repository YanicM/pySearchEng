  "text": "Dear Stannie I met Kettle today and he will work for me. I am to get signed testimonials: one from Piccolo, one from Universit√† del Popolo, one from the bankers in Rome. This latter I have written for. Go at once (I have only twenty days within which to apply) to Prezioso and Rascovich (or Oberdorfer) and explain to them fully the entire case and ask each of them to write a letter on official paper with heading saying that I have written signed leaders (or delivered lectures) with some expressions of commendation. The stronger and more serious looking the letters are: the better. Do this without delay. Maunsel and Co find Dubliners unlikely to be a commercial success. I have offered to bear part of the expenses if a royalty will be paid me from the start. This proposal is now under their consideration. Send me by registered post the new version of my novel which Kettle wishes to see. He has been extremely friendly and wishes me to apply for the lectureship in Italian at the New University. I rely on you to send me what I ask for at once. Jim",
