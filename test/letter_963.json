  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: It is very dark in this salon to write. We left Dieppe last evening as neither my wife nor I has been over well. I fatigued myself to exhaustion point over Ya. I am glad you like the fable. Chatto and Windus put out a prospectus which Miss Beach has announcing a colossal new work in the press by Lewis. The text says ‘the only work that can at all hold a card to it is—’. You can supply the blank. I think I have managed to get Pound to testify in the Roth case. Roth’s counsel raised his name frequently and a refusal on E P’s part would be taken as a tacit admission that Roth was right. I enclose a letter from V.L. (which please send back to my Paris address) and I shall have to patch up that too when I get back. I think I have also nipped in the bud a nascent unpleasantness between Antheil and Miss Monnier: The latter had a kind of offer from the Cologne opera to put on the Cyclops in October if I would go there and be present at a reception. I hate these things but I agreed to go there as he is in a bad way and in poor health. Between ourselves as V L puts it I don’t think he has written 20 bars of the piece in the last four or five years but I pretend to think it is getting on splendidly. The rest is now up to him. The Abbey Theatre has engaged him to do a ballet on Cuchulain fighting the waves. I have been reading about the author of ‘Alice’. A few things about him are rather curious. He was born a few miles from Warrington (Daresbury), and he had a strong stutter and when he wrote he inverted his name like Tristan and Swift. His name was Charles Lutwidge of which he made Lewis (i.e. Ludwig) Carroll (i.e. Carolus). Yes I should like to see a few copies of that paper. Dr Ellwood is the original of Temple in the Portrait. He is quite as accurate as ever, I see. We return to Paris in a day or two. I hope the sea air did us some sort of good. It is madness to work till the very last instant for 15 months at a stretch as I do in Paris. I have lost 6 kilos in weight. But I hope to have determination enough to stop it and get off for a good spell of holiday. There are moments when I feel 20 but also half-hours when I feel 965. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
