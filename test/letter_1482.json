  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: My son reports that no copy of Gorman’s biography of me is to be found in Paris bookshops. The publisher did not send me a copy and the one I possess I bought from Brentano’s, Paris, six weeks ago. Seemingly, no other copy has come since. As I very much wish to send a copy to my mother-in-law can you find out whether a copy is to be had in London and send it on to her if you find it? The address is: Mrs Barnacle, 4 Bowling Green, Galway, Ireland. It will give her great pleasure to have it. I hope you are well, as usual…. My grandson is here and I am trying to have my daughter transferred to a place near here from La Baule. It is not easy at present. I wrote to her trying to explain part of what had happened. She has written agreeing to the transfer which however will be an unpleasant change for her. With many thanks in advance and kindest regards.",
