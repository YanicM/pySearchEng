  "text": "Dear Budgen: Up to now my idea has not worked badly. Lucia, apart from initial melancholy, has stayed down there a month and will stay on till she goes back to Paris in September. For myself the news is not good. Vogt is naturally annoyed with me. He does not believe he can save the right eye from going blind. I should have left everything else aside and come back before while it was still operatable. He will return for a few hours to Z’ch in a fortnight and may let me know definitely then. Of course, he says, it might need 2 or 3 operations (which would make the baker’s dozen)—a major and some secondary ones. He is, of course, the only man in Europe who can do it but what about me in my present Wirbel of worries. What a climate! Platzregen all the time. Do not let yourself be discouraged by anything I may have said about your book. I hope you will go on with it. But if you had 28 years’ experience of English publishers you would proceed very warily with them as I do. Besides, public houses solemn promises are not quite as lasting as the Rütlischwur. A pity you could not have talked more with S. He would have gone on for hours about painting probably. Did you know of a little habit the Helvetians have on their national day. They cut off all the draught wine, will serve only full bottles (whole) of wine in bottle and this à l’écarté—like Horseshow whisky in Dublin? Or is this new? Half the streets of Z’ch are ripped up. I seem to be always coming back here. What trouble my eyes have given me! We had Ruggiero to dinner the other night. Still loquacious on the subjects of frog cooking, Abdul Hamid, Armenians, etc. If I knew Sargent’s address in Lugano I would send him a card Sincerely yours James Joyce",
