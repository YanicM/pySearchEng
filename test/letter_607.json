  "text": "Dear Pound: I am exhausted. An entire month of flathunting, out every morning and back at night, in taxis, buses, trams, trains, lifts, agencies, newspaper offices. I spent about 500 francs I am sure and found nothing so we are here again. I used to carry different parts of the Circe episode about with me. Very pleasant indeed. Also the case of books I had sent on from Trieste went astray. I had to write and wire and interview numerous people. I feared it was lost. At last it arrived after four months of its odyssey. I ought to have written to Mr Quinn before but did not know what address to give. I thought of leaving Paris altogether. I shall write to him tomorrow. I am too tired today as we have just moved in here. I like the landlord here and his wife. They are very agreeable people but it is terribly dear. I have the room you engaged when we came. Si torna all’antico. For today perhaps you can write or transmit to Mr Quinn as follows. I knew nothing of the affair till yesterday when Mr Thayer of the Dial wrote to me offering two cents a word or more in exceptional case and saying that he was sorry about the Little Review. This explained nothing and I had heard nothing from Miss Anderson, Miss Heap or Mr Rodker. In fact Mr Rodker at my suggestion had arranged, I thought, for the publication of The Oxen of the Sun episode in one entire number as I expected them to finish Circe in November but it will be delayed till December. The typescript was sent on by you from Sirmione on 9 June. The MS is in Mr Quinn’s possession now and Mr Huebsch, against my wish, brought to New York a third copy in type. The last number of the L.R. I saw was the July-August number with the close of the Nausikaa episode. Has no number appeared since then or has The Oxen of the Sun episode been published wholly or in part? Is the Little Review closed? Mr Quinn states that in his view there is one chance in nine of the official he names agreeing to his proposal. In that case it seems to me that my intervention is useless. He also states that some arrangement has been made for a private edition to be published by Mr Huebsch for which I am to receive 2500 $. This is very pleasant news but before anything is concluded I must take advantage of the offer Mr Quinn made me lately of his legal services…. The picture of Mr Quinn trying to teach the attorneygeneral (if that be his title) to spell my name is rather amusing. I suppose Mr Quinn pronounces it as I myself pronounce it. The result would possibly have been more successful if, in his plaidoirie with that functionary, he had alluded to me as ‘Mustard Joyhorse’. Very sincerely yours James Joyce",
