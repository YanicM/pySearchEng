  "text": "My little silent Nora Days and days have passed without a letter from you but I suppose you thought I would have left before now. We leave tomorrow night. By the end of the week or by Sunday we will be together, I hope. Now, my darling Nora, I want you to read over and over all I have written to you. Some of it is ugly, obscene and bestial, some of it is pure and holy and spiritual: all of it is myself. And I think you see now what I feel towards you. You will not quarrel with me any more, will you, dear? You will keep my love always alive. I am tired tonight, my dearest, and I would like to sleep in your arms, not to do anything to you but just to sleep, sleep, sleep in your arms. What a holiday! I have not enjoyed myself in the least. My nerves are in a dreadful state from worry of all kinds. Will you nurse me when I go back to you? I hope you take that cocoa every day and I hope that little body of you⁠[rs] (or rather certain parts of it) are getting a little fuller. I am laughing at this moment as I think of those little girl’s breasts of yours. You are a ridiculous person, Nora! Remember you are now twenty-four and your eldest child is four. Damn it, Nora, you must try to live up to your reputation and cease to be the little curious Galway girl you are and become a full happy loving woman. And yet how tender my heart becomes when I think of your slight shoulders and girlish limbs. What a rogue you are! Was it to look like a girl you cut away the hair between your legs? I wish you would wear black underclothes. I wish you would study how to please me, to provoke my desire of you. And you will, dearest, and we will be happy now, I feel. How long the journey will be going back but O how glorious will be the first kiss between us. Do not cry, dear, when you see me. I want to see your eyes beautiful and aglow. What will you say to me first, I wonder? La nostra bella Trieste! I have often said that angrily but tonight I feel it true. I long to see the lights twinkling along the riva as the train passes Miramar. After all, Nora, it is the city which has sheltered us. I came back to it jaded and moneyless after my folly in Rome and now again after this absence. You love me, do you not? You will take me now into your bosom and shelter me and perhaps pity me for my sins and follies and lead me like a child. I would in that sweet bosom be (O sweet it is and fair it is!) Where no rude wind might visit me. Because of sad austerities I would in that sweet bosom be. I would be ever in that heart (O soft I knock and soft entreat her!) Where only peace might be my part. Austerities were all the sweeter So I were ever in that heart. Jim",
