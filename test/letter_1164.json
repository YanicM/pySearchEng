  "text": "Dear Stephens: Herewith a photo of your quasi namesake and his grandfather. To return for a moment to G.M.’s funeral I read that the British Prime Minister was there. This is more than can be said for the I.F.S. or I.R.A. or whatever their initials are. You told me you knew him and sometimes met him socially. I know nothing about him except this one fact and that some English doctor operated on his eye. I think you ought to tell him about Vogt. All the oculists I tried in London, eight or nine, were quite incompetent. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
