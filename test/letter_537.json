  "text": "Dear Sir, My attention has been drawn to a letter recently written by your Society to Mr Curti, Solicitor, of Zurich. As the partner of Mr Sykes I should like to bring a few facts to your notice. Mr Sykes and I founded the English Players company in Zurich in April 1918 for the production of plays in the English language. The company produced plays in English in spite of difficulty, boycott and financial loss, and was the only enterprise of the kind in Switzerland during the war. It was impossible for Mr Sykes to obtain in some cases the consent of the dramatists owing to the postal delays, censorship and frequent and prolonged closure of frontiers, although every effort was made to avoid what might have seemed an infringement of literary courtesy. Mr Sykes was in direct communication with Mr Edward Martyn, who gave him permission to produce The Heather Field, with Mr Meyer, agent of the late Stanley Houghton, who gave him permission to produce Hindle Wakes, and with Mr Robert Ross (deceased) and Mr Samuel French with regard to the production of Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest. He has asked Mr Curti therefore to let him know the names of the authors who are claiming fees. The question of the production on the Continent of Europe of plays in the English language seems, moreover, to be an exceptional case not foreseen in the clauses of the Berne convention. Mr Sykes was legally advised on this subject at the outset that such productions were free. The aims and achievements of the company are such, I believe, as will be approved of by the members of your Society, and, owing to Mr Sykes’ energy and persistance, the prospects financially and artistically are now much brighter. My name as a writer will perhaps not be unknown to you, and I am indebted to your Society for generous and timely aid in the past. I trust that the proposal which Mr Curti is forwarding you on our behalf will meet with your approval and put an end to any misunderstanding which may have arisen. I am, dear Sir, Sincerely yours, James Joyce",
