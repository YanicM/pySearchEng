  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for your kind inquiries. I am better but still in cure. I can also read and write more easily and yesterday could go out without black glasses. I have been to see a specialist who confirms the opinion of my doctor but agrees to postpone the operation. He says, however, that I must not go to the country as I must always have a doctor at hand, glaucoma being very dangerous and my eye very ‘launisch’—like its owner. In these circumstances I have not been able to do very much with my book Ulysses: but I have done what I could. Thanks for the notice from the Challenge. The press has been very good. I am sorry to hear that the sales are so poor. My book of stories had a good press also yet my royalties after three years came to 2/6. The publisher recently disposed of the rest of the edition to my New York publisher as remainders. I think it right to say that you have my permission to do the same (if my permission be needed) whenever the sales reach an unprofitable point. I think you have had quite enough unrewarded trouble till now. May I ask you to give me the address of the musical critic of your paper, Mr Henry, as a Spanish composer, whose acquaintance I made here, has read some of his articles and would like to write to him. I do not know if you wish to get continental notices of the book. I asked the correspondent of the Stampa (Turin) to notice it. He declined, space being limited. It is not easy to do these things for one s own book. The Corriere della Sera (Milan) has a large circulation. Do you know the London correspondent or anyone who knows him? Or perhaps you could send a copy to the Marzocco (via Enrico Poggi, Firenze) or to Mr Nicolo Vidacovich, C/O Nuova Antologia (Piazza di Spagna, Rome). I do not know where Mr Vidacovich is but probably the editor of that review will know. It would be well to enclose perhaps a copy of the English press notices which you printed on the back page of one of your numbers. In any case I should not advise you to venture more than two or three copies on these suggestions With many kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
