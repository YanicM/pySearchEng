  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: O is out today. Up till the last day I had to supervise it and check the references etc made by the 12 yet on opening it this morning I light on the word ‘whoreson’ classified by … among the neologisms coined by W.S. in Cymbeline! I gave the title Tales Told of Shem and Shaun to the Crosby book. J.N.W. Sullivan having declined to do the preface I proposed to them C.K. Ogden (author in part of The Meaning of Meaning) who did a very useful introduction. Picasso was too busy painting somebody so the next aim was Brancusi. He did a kind of a head of me which the C’s didn’t much like so he went on and did something like this Of course it’s not all sideways like that but those are the lines and it’s signed and called Symbol of J.J. The book is out on Saturday. I consider the preface a great gain. I got on well with Brancusi (who is something of a fogey like myself) deploring modern feminine fashions, the speed of a fogey like myself) deploring modern feminine fashions, the speed of modern trains etc etc. His design of me will attract certain buyers. But I wish he or Antheil, say, could or would be as explicit as I try to be people ask me: And what’s this here, Guvnor? I got S.G. to write to Courtney, editor of the Fortnightly, reminding him of my first in literature and proposing a chapter (Hades) for the review. Courtney died last November but the acting editor was taken by the idea and took S.G.’s article—to appear in July. This is also a nice wide breach made by the long gun you sometimes hear of. Aldington came to see me. Des Imagistes the collection of poems published about 1500 years ago is to come in a new form. i.e. contributions by the three more less unknown contributors. I, not having any verse and not wishing to seem un-colleaguelike proposed to give him Kevin’s page from Pt II. I have looked for it but can’t find it, high or low. So could you please make me a copy when you have time therefor. There being nothing of mine in the current No. of ‘transition’ I got Jolas to translate Curtius article for it and put in Beckett’s and the glossary part of S.G.’s. With kindest regards Don’t fail to read special summer No. tomorrow containing account of A M’s picnic, E P’s dinner and a hundred other bright features. Wenn es ist furchtbar heiss Lessen die Jeiss!",
