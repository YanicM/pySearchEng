  "text": "Dear Mrs Byrne, I am very glad to meet my old friend Byrne after so many years and it is most kind of you to allow him to stay a few days. I hope you will not be annoyed if we press him to stay over the weekend as the weather is very fine and he ought to see a number of things here before he leaves. The change too will do him good. He will go back on Monday or Tuesday unless you should wish him to return earlier. With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
