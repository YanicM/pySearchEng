I have been working on the last proofs till this morning and am exhausted. Thanks for your good wishes for my birthday and please give our regards to the Suters. My wife is better but the excitement has made her very nervous. Was it you who sent me My Three Husbands. If so how much do I owe you? James Joyce",
