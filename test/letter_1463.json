  "text": "Dear Mr Brody: Thank you for your Christmas greetings. I hope you and all your family are well. Another misfortune has fallen on mine. My daughter-in-law has had a dreadful mental breakdown and is interned. I have had to take over the child who is in a boarding school here. My son’s entire family life seems to be ruined. As if the affairs of my poor daughter were not enough! I hear today that the Italian version of Anna Livia is to be published shortly in a review in Rome. Do you think it would be possible to publish the version you have in Holland? After all it is only about rivers and washerwomen. I wonder whether that Dutch critic whose address you sent me—I must look for his name—ever found his way through my book. He wrote a very remarkable essay as [far as] it goes. I have had several more reviews in Spanish, Italian, a very long one by a Harvard professor, a Russian (the best so far) and—naturally, I suppose—the most curious of all, a symbolical commentary sent me from Helsinki where, as predicted, the ‘Finn again wakes’. The Dutch critic’s name is G.B. van der Vat (c/o Dr Zandwoort, The Plague (English Studies). Greetings to Mrs Brody and yourself from us both sincerely yours James Joyce",
