  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Thanks for cheque from Egoist (132.80 frs) duly received today. Will you please lend at once to the Stage Society the other typescript of Exiles as the society’s committee wish to put the play on their next season’s programme. If you have no typescript please write to them meanwhile and ask Mr Richards to have a proof pulled if the play is not now obtainable in book form. Mr Sturge Moore who writes me says there is no time to be lost in the matter. I hear many complaints from people that they cannot get copies of my book Dubliners to buy. Is Mr Richards going to publish a second edition or not if it is out of print? I hope you will be successful in your attempt to obtain some money from my New York publisher as my stay here depends on my receiving same without more delay. With thanks again sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. As I said in my former letter which may not have reached you I should like you to cable to New York for some of royalties due and transmit to me, less charge and commission, also by wire to save time. James Joyce",
