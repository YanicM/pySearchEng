  "text": "Dear Lucia: Thanks for the tie. It is very pretty. One part of it is a little too thick for the collar I wear but I will get it changed at the tricoteuse. Today at last I have been able to send off the book. Slow but sure. All’s well that ends well. I will try to arrange for the publication of the alphabet. I hope that Dr Humbert has recovered. I had a long letter from Dr Forel. He told me that they have a new treatment which will do you a lot of good. I don’t know what it is. But the essential thing is that you will benefit from it. It has been suffocating here for some days and I hope that down there by the lake [of Geneva] it is a little cooler. I have not yet made any plans for the summer—the most unpleasant season of the year. [Inserted in Mrs Joyce’s writing] Many greetings and I hope that you are better. Mamma Mamma has finished this letter in the very middle because she was going out and it was not yet finished. After all I haven’t much to add. I work every day and we go to the theatre now and then. Let me know if the book pleases you. I like it very much. Lord knows what my prose means. In a word, it is pleasing to the ear. And your drawings are pleasing to the eye. That is enough, it seems to me. I am sure that your stay and the peacefulness will do you a great deal of good and that one fine day—and soon—the clouds will roll away. They are not storm clouds but only cloudlets. Now I think I will go round to the barber to have my hair cut. If you need anything let me know—music etc. Apropos of that Mamma said something about clothes for the summer. But she has just gone out. I will write to you tomorrow about it. I had forgotten. I received and signed the sheets for the de luxe edition. This will be out in ten days. The other is already on sale. I will send you cuttings from papers where your name is mentioned.",
