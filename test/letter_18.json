  "text": "Dear Pappie I have paid Baa-baa black sheep her bill 30s/– and have enough money to last me till Friday morning. Then I shall have finished the first half of my second month and I shall send you a table showing reduction of expenses. Stannie is to go tonight after you get this (not before eleven) to the ‘Express’, ask to see the editor and say from me that I should like to receive payment for my articles. Stannie could also suggest another batch of books to review. I am annoyed to hear that my article is not yet in the ‘Speaker’ as this defers payment for a week at least. I hear no news of O’Hara—no news on which I can act. Jim",
