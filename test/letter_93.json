  "text": "and tomorrow (Monday) for example in this torrid weather I have to give eight lessons during which I must keep continually on the alert and interested. Many of the frigidities of The Boarding-House and Counterparts were written while the sweat streamed down my face on to the handkerchief which protected my collar. I have had only two swims because it is far out to the baths and I very seldom have more than two hours free at any time. I will confess to you in confidence that I should very much like to eat a slice of boiled leg of mutton with turnips and carrots. Also desirables are a slice of corned beef and cabbage, a sizeable beefsteak prepared on a gridiron, and (excuse the hierarchy) an intelligent supra-burgher like yourself to share the meal. Nora desires to see a kettle on the side of a fire and, though my desire is perhaps a passing one, I fear that hers is permanent. But I will not dilate on this point because it is possible that a letter of yours, on its way here now, I hope, will be so full of sensible statements that I shall have to obliterate corned beef and boiled leg of mutton from the bill of fare indefinitely. The director told me yesterday that as soon as the other English ‘professor’ went away he would raise my salary. This, you will see, would help me greatly in carrying out my designs. If you agree, you are to dispose of my verses and stories broadcast. I am so far away that I can do little or nothing but you are on the spot. Nine stories and twenty verses should yield at the lowest ten pounds and I can easily send you another ten pounds: that makes £20. I am now beginning to be afraid that some such move must be made. Nora seems to me to be in very poor health. All yesterday and the day before she has been laid up with neuralgia and pains and today she seems to be dropping down with weakness. It is very difficult for either of us to enjoy life in these circumstances. The preface to The Vicar of Wakefield which I read yesterday gave me a moment of doubt as to the excellence of my literary manners. It seems so improbable that Hardy, for example, will be spoken of in two hundred years. And yet when I arrived at page two of the narrative I saw the extreme putridity of the social system out of which Goldsmith had reared his flower. Is it possible that, after all, men of letters are no more than entertainers? These discouraging reflections arise perhaps from my surroundings. The stories in Dubliners seem to be indisputably well done but, after all, perhaps many people could do them as well. I am not rewarded by any feeling of having overcome difficulties. Maupassant writes very well, of course, but I am afraid that his moral sense is rather obtuse. The Dublin papers will object to my stories as to a caricature of Dublin life. Do you think there is any truth in this? At times the spirit directing my pen seems to me so plainly mischievous that I am almost prepared to let the Dublin critics have their way. All these pros and cons I must for the nonce lock up in my bosom. Of course do not think that I consider contemporary Irish writing anything but ill-written, morally obtuse formless caricature. The struggle against conventions in which I am at present involved was not entered into by me so much as a protest against these conventions as with the intention of living in conformity with my moral nature. There are some people in Ireland who would call my moral nature oblique, people who think that the whole duty of man consists in paying one’s debts; but in this case Irish opinion is certainly only the caricature of the opinion of any European tribunal. To be judged properly I should not be judged by 12 burghers taken at haphazard, judging under the dictation of a hidebound bureaucrat, in accordance with the evidence of policeman but by some jury composed partly of those of my own class and of my own age presided over by a judge who had solemnly forsworn all English legal methods. But why insist on this point? I do so only because my present lamentable circumstances seem to constitute a certain reproach against me. Jim P.S. I have just received a postcard from Heinemann declining my verses.",
