  "text": "Dear Mr Sullivan: What bad luck! Still, try Hariot for La Juive. They must do the centenary revival at the Opéra and who is to sing Eliezar if not you? By the way, is Le Prophète in your repertory or does the part suit you and how long is it since you sang it? They are giving it at Zurich in September and October and Borach suggested writing the chef d’orchestre to have you invited as Gast for 1 night at 10,000 or 12,000 frs (French). Of course nothing may come of it as usual. However I said I would write to you. Though how the little Stadttheater is going to stage Acts 4 and 5 (unless you supply the explosion) I don’t know. But ce sont leurs oignons. Lucia, I think, is out of the danger zone but will need many months of surveillance. She and her friend are going in a week or so to Vence on condition that we go to Nice for a few months so as to be near them. So we said yes. Will you be singing thereabouts in the autumn? The news in the English press that I have been operated is not correct. I have to go up to Zurich in a week or so to see Vogt who will then say definitely whether he can safely touch the eye or not. What a misfortune that all my worries did not leave me free to go to him 12 months ago. He could have saved the eye then in all probability. But I have had one damned thing after another. You may reply here as your letter will be sent on to my Zurich hotel when I leave. Good luck as always Sincerely yours James Joyce",
