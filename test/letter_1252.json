  "text": "Dear Lucia: I have just received an express letter from which I understand (1) that Eileen has returned to her work and therefore that it is unnecessary for me to send her her salary, (2) that you yourself are in need of money. I will send you some tomorrow. Today the bank is closed. You are much mistaken if you fancy that there is a close tie between me and any member of my family, masculine, feminine or neuter. Since Eileen’s arrival in Ireland I have had only a couple of lines from her and a communication which had neither beginning nor ending to which I have not replied in the manner she wished. It is not possible to say exactly the hour and the day when Mrs Jolas will appear nor the hour and the day when Giorgio will deign to set foot on the quay of ‘la douce France’. Ask me other riddles. Instead of writing to Mamma the letter I suggested to you to write, you have written a letter which drove her half mad. Doubtless that was your intention. If you are unhappy and if you want to go elsewhere I will try to arrange everything and to come to your rescue. Mamma’s uncle offers to come to Dublin in order to take you to Galway. Afterwards you could perhaps go to the islands of Aran where the air is truly delightful and where there are so many stones to split that it is a real pleasure. Today my eyes are not very well but it is simply the weather, I think. Instead of reading sentences about combustible gas and funerals and many other beautiful things I should like to know how much money I should send you every week and to whom to pay it…. Since you ask what I am writing I will send you Transition when it comes out. The devil knows what it means. Enough, as you say yourself.",
