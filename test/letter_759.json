  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for your letter and press cuttings. I suppose you have seen Mr Eliot’s article in the Dial. I like it and it comes opportunely. I shall suggest to him when I write to thank him that in alluding to it elsewhere he use or coin some short phrase, two or three words, such as one he used in speaking to me ‘two plane’. Mr Larbaud gave the reading public about six months ago the phrase ‘interior monologue’ (that is, in Ulysses). Now they want a new phrase. They cannot manage more than about one such phrase every six months—not for lack of intelligence but because they are in a hurry. Thanks also for Arabia Deserta, and the Querschnitt. I wish I could go away somewhere and read the former for my own pleasure but alas in spite of all I said I am working overtime again. My eye is still bandaged but gives me no trouble. I hope to be all right by the middle of the week. I do not know how long more we shall be here. I hope not for Christmas. A certain princess Murat to whom I was introduced (I had hardly shaken hands when I began to recite Je cherche un appartement de cinq ou six pièces, trois chambres, salon, salle à manger) promised she would find me one when she comes back from London. However I caught the cold in my eye on a wildgoose chase to Versailles on a similar errand. Nevertheless I cannot stop now for I must try to block out (roughly, at least) certain parts of the book before my next holiday. The passages typed represent twice or three times as much, the rest being already written in the sense that additions will be made all over the present text from notes to which I have now no access. I see that you leave London on Thursday for a few months holiday in the country. I hope you will enjoy yourself there. I shall [send] on the typescript of the next piece as soon as it is done. This muddled year is ending badly for me as my treasury is now approaching the condition of a Torricellian vacuum. I have made arrangements by which the quarterly interest which I get on 25–28 December will reach me a few days before Christmas (this independently of your solicitors) but until then there is nothing coming in except a remittance of £20 on the 6–8 December. Mr Quinn was to have sent me a cheque in settlement of the Ulysses MS but as you see did not do so. It is a bother that I have to write about this but, apart from the minor matters of board and lodgings, I do not wish to be in this position here at present. I delayed this letter till the last moment hoping that the money you spoke of would come by any post. I daresay your solicitors groan in spirit every time my name is mentioned but perhaps it is now possible for them to advance some of it. I am sure you appreciate my thoughtfulness in thus adding to your worries on the eve of your departure and I know how relieved you will feel if you do not see me on the platform at the station with a barricaded eye and a long list of requests for unobtainable objects. Such therefore is my present condition but as you say the photograph shows me in a favourable light. Mr Pound has ups and downs. He does not always look like that. Perhaps it was because he took off his glasses. The photograph appeared in the New York Times. I am going out with this letter to catch the mail. I hope you will not be annoyed with me for writing it? With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
