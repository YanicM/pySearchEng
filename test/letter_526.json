  "text": "Dear Mr Palmer: I am arranging a vocal concert with Mr Augustus Milner, leading baritone of the Municipal Theatre in Zurich (an Irishman by birth) to be given shortly in the Townhall here. He wants to sing two of your songs, The Man from Galway and your charming setting of my verses O, it was out by Donnycarney. As my music is locked up in my flat in Trieste may I ask you to let me have these songs, if possible, by return. If the latter be now printed so much the better. If not MS will do. I shall remit you in Mr Milner’s name the amount of the former when I know what it costs.",
