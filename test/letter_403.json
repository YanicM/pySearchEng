  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I have sent to Mr Pound two pieces of verse begging him to dispose of them at once to any paper which he may be connected with and, if he cannot do so, to send them to you. The proceeds, together with those of the first piece, I should be glad to receive as soon as possible. Of course your commission is to be deducted in any case. Is there any chance of my receiving any money from Mr Richards for the American magazine rights of the two stories sold by him to The Smart Set? May I ask you to apply to him for it, if I am entitled to it under contract, and to send it to me also deducting your fees. I shall be glad to hear whether the scheme proposed to the Egoist has been accepted or whether Mr Laurie has taken the book on the same terms. I offered the play to the theatre here. It was refused. I am now in correspondence with Berne and Rome on the same subject. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
