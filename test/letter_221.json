  "text": "Dear Stannie For Jesus Christ sake send money unless you want to send me into a madhouse. Nothing can be done here. Go to your best pupil is the simplest. Say the school has planted you and ask for a year’s payment for biweekly lessons as I did with Schmitz. You will get it like a shot and this winter we shall make tons of money and be all as happy as if the divil had us. It would be no use for me to write to my pupils as it would only be drib and drab. Do what I tell you and I want the money by return of post. I have done all my business as well as I could. I did not neglect one thing I had to do. Next year we will save 1000 crowns and Nora and I are going to take our honeymoon. Don’t send money by M.O. Buy a cheque, put it in a letter and send it on at once registered and express and in six days after Eva and I will be there. I am in splendid health again since I came back from Galway tonight. Every day I stay here is money lost. Please give Vidacovich his lessons (which are paid for) for the first half of September, twice a week. Don’t omit this and don’t ask him for money. Send the money. Jim",
