  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I think I have patched up the affair for a while and so am trying to rest a bit here. But transition has sent me a heap of proofs to revise for June and September and Conner a new questionnaire and letter about the copyrighting of the new opus. The explanation about the Austrian paper is. That Fiera invited me to go to Florence paying expense and my lecture fee to represent Ireland. I wrote declining on grounds of health (in Italian of the most courtly description) and suggested to Paolo Orano that my place be taken by James Stephens concerning whom I wrote a fine panegyric, with the result that the honour was offered to him. Mr Stephens came to Paris and saw me and he accepted it of which I am very glad. As regards Ford and his daughter who, by the way, is named like her mother ‘Stella’ I shall write as soon as I have waded through a half dozen of my notebooks of revision. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
