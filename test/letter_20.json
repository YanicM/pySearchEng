  "text": "Dear Stannie I enclose you self-explaining documents though it costs something to send them. Write at once to the ‘Unicorn Press’. Get also the following books if you possibly can. ‘Everyman’ Is/– and 12 Elizabethan Songs (edited with original music by Janet Dodge) 3s/6— both published A H Bullen, 47 Great Russell St, London. I have written fifteen epiphanies—of which twelve are insertions and three additions. I was paid 25 frs on Sat—of which 8 went to pay off a part of my debts.—I shall have to use my tuition money when I am paid, I fear. Synge is here for a few days selling out—he can’t get on either and is going back to Ireland. He says the ‘Speaker’ is always slow but once you get a proof the article is sure to appear. He has written four plays—one of which ‘Riders to the Sea’ Arthur Symons and W B Yeats admire very much—Yeats told me it was quite Greek: and I suppose Synge will be boomed now by the Irish Theatre—the plays are all in one act. Synge gave me the MS of ‘Riders to the Sea’ and I have read it: it is a play of Aran in peasant dialect. I am glad to say that ever since I read it I have been riddling it mentally till it has [not] a sound spot. It is tragic about all the men that are drowned in the islands: but thanks be to God Synge isn’t an Aristotelian. I told him part of my esthetic: he says I have a mind like Spinosa. I cannot write a long letter as I am running for the post. I shall write to Charlie at the end of the week: tell him so. If you can knock out a few shillings on your own hook, do so and send them in God his name. I am half planning an entertainment. Tell me what you think of all this. Tell mother to go out now that spring is come and take walks. Damnably cold here. Jim",
