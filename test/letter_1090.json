  "text": "Dear Eliot: I was waiting for the proof promised me when we decided that the one pulled on 21 September was not clear enough. It has now (21 November) reached me and apparently was pulled on 16 October and is identical with that of 21 September, see enclosed. I suppose that ends the matter. Do you want to set up part 1.? If so, I could send it. Has anything been arranged about the volume of essays? I cannot make up my mind about Zurich yet. With kind regards to Mrs Eliot and yourself sincerely yours James Joyce",
