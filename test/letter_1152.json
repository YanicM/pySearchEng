  "text": "Dear Mr Bergan: Your letter has followed me up from Nice. I could not read the pencilled date in the inscription but now that everything is right can you let me know when the stone can be erected? Yesterday I sent you an article about my daughter which may amuse you. I never receive journalists, French or English. The one who wrote this article seems to think I am 80 years old. I am, however, a grandfather and here is a bad snapshot of myself and my first grandson, Stephen James, taken a month ago at Nice. There is a point on which I should like to have your advice. An American writer is doing a biography of me and he wants information about my ancestors. You may remember the family portraits (now in the possession of my son Giorgio). These represent besides Tuohy’s splendid portrait of my father (born at Cork, 4 July 1849) my grandfather, James, born, I think in Fermoy, who married Ellen O’Connell, second cousin to Dan, and my great grandfather James who married Anne McCann of Ulster. The American writer wants to go back a few more generations on the Joyce side. Is my father’s birth registrated also at Charlemont Hse and could I find in that entry the date and place of the birth of my grandfather James (approximately 1828 at Fermoy, Rose Cottage) and if I found that would it have the date and place of birth of my great grandfather from which I could obtain the information required? Or should enquiries be made at Cork and Fermoy? The publishers would pay a small fee for research, I suppose. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
