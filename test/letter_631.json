  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for your kind wishes for my birthday. I have not been troubled with my eyes since I moved in here but the neuralgia continued. Now it has ceased. I ought to have acknowledged before with thanks the receipt of Mr Upward’s book, the first part of which seems to me like a running marginal comment on Circe, a compliment which, I suspect, the author would be the first to deprecate. I finished that episode some weeks ago and sent it to be typed. It was returned to me by four typists as impossible. Finally it was passed into the hands of a fifth who, however, has only an hour or two free in the day to work at it, so that it will not be ready for some weeks more. It will run, I am told, to about 160 pages of typescript. On Monday I hope to deliver to another typist the first part of the Eumeus episode and the rest in a week or a fortnight. This will leave me the time I need for composing the two final and shorter episodes. Circe has tired me very much in every way and I am very glad Ulysses had not a thirteenth adventure. I wish I had some definite news to give you about my books here. I have not heard or seen anything of the person who is supposed to be translating my novel. The production of Exiles has been postponed till April or May owing to the success of a play which Mr Lugné Poë put on. Of the projected translation of Dubliners I heard nothing since I wrote last. Mr Eliot, who was here lately, told me of Mr Aldington’s article to which, it seems, he (Mr Eliot) is replying by arrangement with Mr Aldington. The latter’s standpoint, so far as I could gather from Mr Eliot, seems to me legitimate criticism but I expect that his article will go beyond those limits. The atmosphere of vacillation of which I spoke to you by no means ends there: and the episode I have just written will have the effect of consolidating it, I expect, as it offers a good front for attack. I am glad there is some prospect of advance sales in England for Ulysses though I think that Mr Huebsch will change his mind several times between now and the date of publication. Mr Quinn can be relied on to a certain extent, in spite of his violent opposition (as I was informed by Mr Pound) to certain chapters of the book as it was proceeding, since he has committed himself to a certain extent and his opposition (very natural, for the rest) has changed apparently to admiration. Silence is a help in these matters. Mr Pound and Mr Rodker were in Paris some weeks ago but I do not know where they have gone. Mr Pound, according to an article in the New York Herald has left England for good and will settle down in Paris. Mr Rodker, I believe, is going to Spain. I shall write to Mr Pound in a day or two as I should like to send the typescript of Circe through him as I have done hitherto though I do not think that the reading of such a Walpurgisnacht will do his or anybody else’s health much good. I hope the projected edition of Ulysses will come out in June. No definite proposals have yet been made to me. Mr Quinn suggested an edition of 1500 copies at $12.50 each on which I was to receive $2, the edition to be subscribed. I wrote asking for details and information as regards the English edition for which Mr Pinker once upon a time drew up a contract. As soon as I have a reply I shall let you know.",
