  "text": "Dear Sir In reply to yours of 18th inst possibly the book was well pushed in England as you say but it certainly was not in Ireland. When I was there last summer very many people complained to me that it had never been in the windows at all. I have arranged with Messrs Maunsel that when my book of stories Dubliners comes out he is to insert a leaflet containing press notices of C.M. so that the new book should give the verses a further push. Perhaps you could come to some understanding with Messrs Maunsel on the subject and it would be to your advantage as well as to mine. At the same time (and in spite of the philosophical temper of the poets you allude to) I am surprised at the lowness of the sales. Mr Symons wrote me a day or so after its publication that an American lady had bought 12 copies. I had the enclosed leaflet printed at my own expense and myself disposed of at least 30 copies here and in other cities where I lived. I have arranged with a local bookseller to take on fifty copies of Dubliners here and these are already subscribed for. Perhaps I could induce him at the same time to take on a score of copies of the verses. As regards musical fees as it is now three years since the book appeared I should feel obliged if you will kindly remit me by return the amount (50%) due to me on same as per agreement. The moral of Mr Reynolds’s complaints is that should Mr O’Brien Butler write for leave to music part of the book you are to facilitate him. So far as I understood Mr Reynolds his ground of complaint was that you had refused me [sic] leave to set one song, saying that you had disposed of the exclusive right of it. Yours very truly James Joyce",
