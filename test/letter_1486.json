  "text": "Dear Mrs Colum: We are here for a few days but the address at foot will find me till the 15 July when my lease of that unoccupied flat expires. We return to S. Gérand-le-Puy tonight. It was news to me to hear that Byrne had written a book. I should have been surprised to hear that he had read one. Nevertheless it might be a quite remarkable book and in any case he is a very old friend of mine. If you see him let me know how you find him. I did not think he was very well when I last saw him. No, I have not seen your review of Gorman’s book. I have no copy of it myself. I have been trying to buy one in London or Paris but no bookshop in either city seems to have a copy according to Miss Weaver (London) and Giorgio (Paris). Neither Gorman nor his publishers sent me a copy or informed me of the date of publication or notified me that it was published or sent me any critique of it. I should not even know it was out but for Selskar Gunn who sent me a clipping from the New Yorker. I cabled the publishers in November but had no reply. Also I have not seen any of the reviews you cite of Finnegans Wake; the publishers of that book, or rather Mr B.W. Huebsch of the firm, were written to by me on 6 December last. I sent the letter by U.S. Clipper as I send this and as you had better send mail if you write to Europe. I explained to him the very great difficulty one had in getting any money whatsoever out of England, even small monthly interest on War Loans, for the support of my doubly evacuated family and asked him to send out by his quickest possible way to my account at Lloyds Bank, Paris, any royalties due to me. He replied to this letter of mine of 6 December 1939 on the 17 February 1940 replying by long sea mail routes, a letter which reached me on the 11 March. His letter contained an account of sales of my books for the previous half year. Exiles, O, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, O, Dubliners, 6. He also enclosed a cheque for the royalties due me on Finnegans Wake, viz, 47 $ 45 (forty seven dollars 45/100)…. Whatever happens, thanks for having remembered us at this time, and I hope you will both let us know how you fare.",
