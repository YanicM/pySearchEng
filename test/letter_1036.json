  "text": "Dear Mrs Schmitz: I am here again seeing prof. Vogt about my eyes but he cannot operate them at present owing to their state and that of the weather here so that I must come back in the spring for a very difficult operation on the right eye. I am writing to your friends in Paris to telephone me there after Saturday and shall explain to them what my idea is about the preface to Schmitzâ€™s book. I hope you are quite well and all the other members of the family. With friendly remembrances also from my wife. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
