  "text": "Dear Stannie Our plans have been approved of and we now await police licence for music. I am busy from early morning till late at night. Cut down expenses as much as possible and pay the landlord and the piano. I must try to save £10 to cover Eileen’s fare and my own and I know that the burden of this house will be thrown all on my shoulders in a week. I send you settings of my songs by Reynolds whom I met in Belfast and a setting of It is Far. A book of Dublin verse has come out containing three of mine, Strings, Bid Adieu and What Counsel. We expect to leave here on the 27th to be in time for Capo d’anno. How is your voice getting on? Roberts promised me the first proofs for next week. Our advts go on the hoardings tomorrow. Eileen and Eva can manage together all January then Eva can return by herself. M’s brother-in-law Novak our manager and the operator arrived tonight and are also at Finn’s. I see nobody and am of course dead sick of Dublin. Burn all copies in MS of my Chamber Music. Get an overcoat. Jim",
