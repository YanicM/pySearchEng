  "text": "Dear Mr Craig: Many thanks for your letter and friendly offices and please convey to Professor Ogilvie my son’s and my thanks in advance. You must have had an inspiring influence on my friend Eugene Jolas for the day after it he suddenly guessed the title of my book which nobody has succeeded in doing for the past sixteen years, thereby winning a wager of 1000 frs which I had rashly made. He is now on the top of one of his French Maritime Alps, Ubelle, with his secret and perhaps I should ask Loki to make a hedge of fire round the foot until I have written the final full stop. (There is none). The name of the song is, I think ‘The Lord in His mercy be kind (not good) to Belfast’. I have been trying for many years to get the air and words of it and also of ‘Follow me up to Carlow’. With thanks once more sincerely yours James Joyce",
