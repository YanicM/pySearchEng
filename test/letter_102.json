  "text": "Dear Stannie Please send me the information I ask you for as follows: The Sisters: Can a priest be buried in a habit? Ivy Day in the Committee Room—Are Aungier St and Wicklow in the Royal Exchange Ward? Can a municipal election take place in October? A Painful Case—Are the police at Sydney Parade of the D division? Would the city ambulance be called out to Sydney Parade for an accident? Would an accident at Sydney Parade be treated at Vincent’s Hospital? After the Race—Are the police supplied with provisions by government or by private contracts? Kindly answer these questions as quickly as possible. I sent my story The Clay (which I had slightly rewritten) to The LITERARY World but the cursedly stupid ape that conducts that journal neither acknowledged it nor sent it back. This kind of thing is maddening. Am I an imbecile or are these people imbeciles. That journalist that wrote so superiorly about Tolstoy is (thank the devil) dead and, I hope, damned. By the Lord Christ I must get rid of some of these Jewish bowels I have in me yet. I went out yesterday for a walk in a big wood outside Trieste. The damned monotonous summer was over and the rain and soft air made me think of the beautiful (I am serious) climate of Ireland. I hate a damn silly sun that makes men into butter. I sat down miles away from everybody on a bench surrounded by tall trees. The Bora (the Trieste Wind) was roaring through the tops of the trees. I sniffed up all the fragrance of the earth and offered up the following prayer (not identical with that which Renan offered upon the Acropolis) O Vague Something behind Everything! For the love of the Lord Christ change my curse-o’-God state of affairs. Give me for Christ’ sake a pen and an ink-bottle and some peace of mind and then, by the crucified Jaysus, if I don’t sharpen that little pen and dip it into fermented ink and write tiny little sentences about the people who betrayed me send me to hell. After all, there are many ways of betraying people. It wasn’t only the Galilean suffered that. Whoever the hell you are, I inform you that this [is] a poor comedy vou expect me to play and I’m damned to hell if I’ll play it for you. What do you mean by urging me to be forbearing? For your sake I refrained from taking a little black fellow from Bristol by the nape of the neck and hurling him into the street when he spat some of his hatched venom at me. But my heroic nature urged me to do this because he was smaller than I. For your sake, I allowed a cyclist to use towards me his ignoble and cowardly manners, pretending to see nothing, pretending that he was my equal. I sorrowfully confess to you, old chap, that I was a damn fool. But if you only grant me that thing I ask you for I will go to Paris where, I believe, there is a person by the name of Anatole France much admired by a Celtic philologist by the name of Goodbetterbest and I’ll say to him ‘Respected master, is this pen pointed enough?’ Amen. It is possible that the delusion I have with regard to my power to write will be killed by adverse circumstances. But the delusion which will never leave me is that I am an artist by temperament. Newman and Renan, for example, are excellent writers but they seem to have very little of the temperament I mean. Whereas Rimbaud, who is hardly a writer at all, has it. Of course Renan is an artist and must have the temperament but it is balanced by the temperament of a philo⁠[lo]⁠gist. Newman must have it too but balanced by the temperament of a theologian. I am neither savant nor saint. Grant Richards wrote to me, saying how much he admired Chamber Music but adding that, with the present public taste, he could not take more than part of the risk. I wrote back thanking him (I daresay he has no money himself) and saying I had no money. I wrote to Heinemann telling him about Dubliners and asking would he read it and consider it. I shall send you on Wednesday or Thursday the tenth story A Mother and the book will be finished by the first of November. You might let me know what you think of it as I intend to dedicate it to you. You are a long time sitting on my novel. I wish you’d say what you think of it. The only book I know like it is Lermontoff’s Hero of Our Days. Of course mine is much longer and Lermontoff’s hero is an aristocrat and a tired man and a brave animal. But there is a likeness in the aim and title and at times in the acid treatment. Lermontoff describes at the end of the book a duel between the hero and G—, in which G— is shot and falls over a precipice in the Caucasus. The original of G—, stung by the satire of the writer, challenged Lermontoff to a duel. The duel was fought on the brink of a precipice in the Caucasus as described in the book. Lermontoff was shot dead and rolled over the precipice. You can imagine the thought that came into my mind. The book impressed me very much. It is much more interesting than any of Turgénieff’s. Will you read some English ‘realists’ I see mentioned in the papers and see what they are like—Gissing, Arthur Morrison and a man named Keary. I can read very little and am as dumb as a stockfish. But really I think that the two last stories I sent you are very good. Perhaps they will be refused by Heinemann. The order of the stories is as follows. The Sisters, An Encounter and another story which are stories of my childhood: The Boarding-House, After the Race and Eveline, which are stories of adolescence: The Clay, Counterparts, and A Painful Case which are stories of mature life: Ivy Day in the Committee Room, A Mother and the last story of the book which are stories of public life in Dublin. When you remember that Dublin has been a capital for thousands of years, that it is the ‘second’ city of the British Empire, that it is nearly three times as big as Venice it seems strange that no artist has given it to the world. I read that silly, wretched book of Moore’s ‘The Untilled Field’ which the Americans found so remarkable for its ‘craftsmanship’. O, dear me! It is very dull and flat, indeed: and ill written. Jim PS No letter from you again today. I will fall in love with you if you keep on dodging the post like this much longer. What in the name of God are you at? If you don’t answer at once, by God, I’ll go to Dublin at once and get my manuscripts. Are you at ‘biz’? An old man, hatless, stockingless and shirtless, a pilgrim, passed my window now on his way to the Holy Land. Two little Triestines went into a hallway and laughed till they beat each other. Funny world!",
