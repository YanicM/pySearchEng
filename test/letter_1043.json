He is at the Marignan and very desirous of meeting you again after so long as am I too. Herewith are a few pages of the French A.L.P. which may amuse you. Please bring them along. I hope you are well. I have not slept decently for a long time and my sight seems to have become temporarily much worse. With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
