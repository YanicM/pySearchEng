I could not get another pupil but I will try again next week if you can send me any money when you get this. You ought to tell Artifoni frankly that our difficulty is to reach the 1st of October after that we will be all right. In a way it is easier for you than for me. You have not to keep up an appearance and you could hardly want a meal. I shall be much obliged if you can answer this appeal and I will try for another pupil—but when am I to teach him?
