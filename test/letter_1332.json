I hope wherever you may be that you are both well in spite of this hideous weather. My piece about the Norwegian captain and the tailor was swamped out in the Ohio floods (transition this time being printed in Cincinnati) but it has been reset and I believe they have now given a second bon Ã  tirer. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
