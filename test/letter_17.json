  "text": "Dear Pappie I received your telegraph order on Tuesday afternoon and dined. As it was the evening of the carnival, I allowed myself some luxuries—a cigar, confetti to throw, and a supper. I bought a stove, a saucepan, a plate, a cup, a saucer, a knife, a fork, a small spoon, a big spoon, a bowl, salt, sugar, figs, macaroni, cocoa &c and got my linen from the laundry. I now try to do my own cooking. For instance last night for dinner I had two hard-boiled eggs (these are sold here hard-boiled during Lent in red shells) bread and butter, macaroni; a few figs and a cup of cocoa. Today for dejeuner I had some cold ham, bread and butter, Swiss cream with sugar; for dinner I had two poached eggs and Vienna bread, macaroni and milk, a cup of cocoa and a few figs. On Sunday for dinner I shall make a mutton stew—mutton, a few potatoes, mushrooms and lentils, with cocoa and biscuits after. Tomorrow (for dejeuner) I shall finish my ham with bread and butter, Swiss cream and sugar, and finish my figs. I think I shall reduce my expenses in this way. Anyhow I hope I shall not fall asleep now as I used dreaming of rice-pudding, which for one who is fasting is not a nice dream. I am sorry to say that after my dinner on Tuesday I became very ill and at night I had a fit of vomiting. I felt very bad the whole of the following day but I am better today except for attacks of neuralgia—induced, I imagine, by my constant periods of fasting. On Tuesday morning I received from the ‘Speaker’ the proof-sheets of my article which will therefore appear Sat. Feb. 28th if I am right. I suppose I shall be paid some time next week. I have no news from the ‘Express’. Stannie tells me my four reviews appeared. I sent them a fortnight ago a criticism of a performance of Sarah Bernhardt’s, as I told you, and a letter with it. I sent today an account of the carnival. As for my other paper it has not come out yet and until the Syndicate approves of the dummy copy no appointments can be made and there is no money. I understand that this dummy is now ready and I have consequently to wait. I shall try to let my tuition money (20 francs and 10 frs) remain intact till the end of March so as to pay my hotel-bill. I was favoured with my hotel-bill on Tuesday (£1–10–0 as I used seven candles (3s/–) before I got a lamp) I hope you will send this to me on the 1ST as the lady here is rather black in the face and has a whimsical way of looking at me when she sees me going up the stairs with milk sticking out of one pocket and bread and provisions out of another. I hope I won’t have to bother you for any more money if I get on all right. I am 18s/– in debt but that be hanged for the present. Your (and my) good friend Mr Tuohy took no notice of my letter as I told you. I see that nothing has been done at the ‘Irish Times’ and if I am [a] good judge of heavy heads nothing will be done with its manager who is, I think, very heavy in the head. I am seriously thinking of entering the church if I find editors and managers and ‘practical’ people so very stubborn as they appear to be. Jim",
