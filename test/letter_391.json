  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Will you please send the next copy of The Egoist to this (my new address)? I am afraid to trouble you once more but I should feel very grateful if you could send me also the issue of 15 January 1914 which contains Mr Poundâ€™s first article on my book of stories. My copy is locked up in my flat in Trieste and it would perhaps be useful for me to have a copy here. I beg you to excuse me for giving you so much trouble and so often. Needless to say I have no news about either my novel or my play. In fact I have not received any letters from London for quite a long time. With many thanks in advance Sincerely yours James Joyce",
