  "text": "Dear MacCormack: I send you the books promised, the novel for you, Dubliners for your brother but shall be obliged if he will return the latter when read as it is out of print. I shall enclose a review of Ulysses if I can find it which is doubtful. My wife wishes me to say that if your daughter finds any afternoon too boresome Lucia (who finds every afternoon boresome, I am afraid) would gladly keep her company. My telephone number is Saxe: 34â€“33. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
