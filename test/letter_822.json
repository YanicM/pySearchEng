  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have leave to read a little but not to write. This is not to tell you a long tale about my eyes but to wish you a happy Christmas. I send you a little book. I hoped it would be Gens de Dublin but it is not out yet. In a few words. The cataract was removed—difficult in an eye which has withstood attacks for eighteen years. I saw splendid sights for a minute or so. Dr Borsch says the sight cannot come back quickly but it will come. ‘The readiness is all.’ There is to be an electric cure when the broken window of my soul can stand more shocks. He is positive as to the result. I am still bandaged up—had prolonged cinema nights and am extrêmement fatigué. When I am better and can see, yes, I should like to go to the south for a little. I will send you all the news in my next letter. Many good wishes from all here. I hope you will enjoy your Christmas in the country and send you my kindest regards. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
