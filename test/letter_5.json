  "text": "Dear Lady Gregory, I am leaving tonight for Paris and I am to meet Mr Yeats tomorrow morning. Mr Longworth wrote to me and I saw Mr Synge. Dr MacLagan also wrote to me. I have not any definite news yet but as soon as I have any I shall tell you. You have been kind to me and only for you I don’t know how I should be. I hope you will forgive me for giving you so much trouble. I am sorry I could not write more often during the week but I am dead tired at present from constant moving about. Let me thank you again for your great kindness. Faithfully yours Jas. A. Joyce",
