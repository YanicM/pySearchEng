  "text": "Dear Helen: I sent off a short letter to Giorgio last night and these few lines are for you. I believe both letters are to go on a boat which takes a couple of weeks to waddle across the sea. But no fast boat is going before the 2 of May, it seems. I am sorry you are having such a poor time over there. Also that your birthday was such a gloomy affair. Well, well! I am afraid my letters cause glee in the family circle. The letters that reach me from your side cause ghastly smiles to break out over my face. From the wording of your last it is not clear who is on crutches, your father or Giorgio. But I hope that by now they have been laid aside. I am glad Lucia wrote to Giorgio. If she sent the letter via Hitlerland it was probably because she mislaid your address. Do you realise, dear daughter-in-law, how very difficult it is for a European to remember such an address as 1689 North West 866th Street, floor no 72, room 10,896? We do our poor old world best. But it is awful hard. I am ordered to inform you of the following, though I feel as if I were putting my handsome Grecian head into a large beehive. The expenses for removal of your goods and chattels (don’t hit me, please, O please put away that umbrella!) were paid by Mrs Eugene Jolas. So my wife thinks this matter should be cleared up soon. Ai! Ai! Ai! In my letter to Giorgio I mention that I had simply sent on F’s opinion. Nobody knows anything about rheumatism except that young people are liable to get it. As for the splendour of American hospitals close your eyes for a moment and try to imagine what the Dublin one must be like after 12 sweepstakes. Can you see those golden staircases, the diamond studded doors, the bedspreads of solid African ivory, the curtains of silk from Samarcand? What a wonderful animal is the horse! I send a copy of Paris Soir which may interest you. I shall write you again in a few days, about the contract and other things as well. Giorgio asked me to kiss for him certain ladies and gentlemen residents of the hamlet. What dangerous advice for any son to give to his father! But I believe they all wish you well nevertheless. The cat I had is gone. The story of the episcopalian minister was too much for him. He has become a mohammadan.",
