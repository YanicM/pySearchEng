  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards I am sorry you have not been able to arrange the introduction by Mr Young but perhaps some of the more sensational part of my preface could be used on a wrapper or showcard. You are the best judge: but I imagine that the story of the burning or some other part of the book’s history might help to push the sale. I hope you will publish before the end of this month as May is a lucky month for me. You can, of course, use any part of the preface if you like—either my text or your own wording. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
