  "text": "Dear Sir: I enclose copy of account sales furnished by my publisher. From the total 499 are to be deducted 120 copies bought by me here and, I suppose, another 120 or so bought in Dublin, Ireland and London by friends, relations and acquaintances, leaving a sale of about 200 copies in seven months. My publisher wrote me on 26 ult: ‘There is no American edition of Dubliners. The letter that was written you speaking of an American edition was evidently written under a misapprehension.’ I have since received a second letter from New York (copy enclosed), confirming the previous one. If the American rights have not been disposed of I cannot understand what it means. My publisher also writes that I should not have allowed anyone to publish serially my novel (A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man) except by arrangement with him and must not arrange for any serial publication in America. My novel began in the The Egoist (the MS having been already delivered by me to Mr Pound) in February 1914. My contract with my publisher was some months later. I shall be glad to hear from you on these points.",
