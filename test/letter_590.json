  "text": "Dear Budgen: Thanks for letter and papers. The latter very useful particularly Bits of Fun of which send me any back numbers you can find. I enclose 10 frs which any bank will change to cover expenses. G. has been offered a position of 500 frs a month to start. Circe goes on very slowly. As regards ‘moly’ it can be chance, also laughter, the enchantment killer. The knock out blow delivered at end brings all things back to their sordid reality. The technical difficulty I mentioned to you torments me. Huebsch is crying off Ulysses. The proposal now is to print it privately at £2 a copy. Case of books never reached me from Trieste and the MS I sent to Quinn some time ago never reached him. Luckily the bulkier parcel from here did. I enclose a letter for Pound. When you have seen him write to me. I hope you will find a room and studio soon. I shall be pleased to see Mr and Mrs Sargenta if they are passing through Paris. How long will you remain in London. This is a bad pen. I want to finish Circe within a month so that anything that strikes you please let me know.",
