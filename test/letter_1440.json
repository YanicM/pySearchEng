  "text": "Dear Budgen: I sent you 33 clippings yesterday and the typescript with some suggestions which you may reject or not as suits you. I enclose P.O. 2/6. Will you please return the clippings by registered letter post so as to reach me by Tuesday, 1 prox, as we plan to leave and I want them back first—not as printed matter. The 6 notices in the [illegible] are 2 by Edmund Wilson and 3 by Paul Rosenfeld (I put them so that you might see the progression) with which is intercalated a letter signed by Faugh-a-Ballaugh-Faugh possibly the last public act of his life. The first instalment of F.W. appeared in his Transatlantic Review (your 4 old men) and it was he who called it ‘Fragment from Work in Progress’. I forgot to put in the reference pages etc in suggestions dictated to P.L. At back of this am putting them down anyway. Wilson makes some curious blunders, e.g. that the 4th old man is Ulster. Your article can easily run to 500/1000 words now. The F.R. paid me 1 gn a page in 1899—16 pp. I think they will take your article if you write in the way I suggested and say who you are. If that fails I shall suggest another review not the Quarterly. A U.S. review is not likely. They have plenty of critics of their own…. The part of F.W. accepted as easiest is section pp. 104 et seq and the most difficult of all [illegible] pp. 260 et seq—yet the technique here is a reproduction of a schoolboy’s (and schoolgirl’s) old classbook complete with marginalia by the twins, who change sides at half time, footnotes by the girl (who doesn’t), a Euclid diagram, funny drawings etc. It was like that in Ur of the Chaldees too, I daresay. Page 626, line 17 (the word heliotrope appears here again after baffling Glugg in the mime, Isolde’s colour too)….If I have left out some please let me know. P.S. Why do you not work in the verses about the names?",
