  "text": "Dear Stannie: MSS came today and sent them on. Am anxious to know if you have safely the envelope left on the credenza with documents. French translation of novel begins in L’Action 1 August. Book publication when serial finished. Lugné Poe, manager Odèon now of L’Oeuvre considering Exiles for production. Translator and publisher for this also found. Admirer of mine has placed 3 room flat, furnished, at my disposal for three months. Address: rue de l’Assomption, 5, I, Passy, Paris. Please let me know about documents. Stopped in Venice two days. Last moment met D. casually. He promised to call at hotel and wire Gattorno Milan for rooms but never turned up after. Linati had rooms ready but the damned post delayed his letter. However we found them. No stop in Switzerland but stayed night in Dijon. Saluti a tutti. Ask Frank if he wants French assignats of the revolution period. Jim",
