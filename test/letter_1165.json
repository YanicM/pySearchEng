  "text": "Dear Mr Bax: Forgive me for my delay in writing to thank you for your setting of my verses in the O.U.P. book. I find it very evocative and the slightly Norwegian strain that runs through it very suitable. It has also the merit, rare nowadays, of being singable. I have received a letter to which I have not yet replied from a Mr Anthony Bax and am wondering if he is a relative of yours as I suppose the name is rather uncommon. Thanking you again for the pleasure your music has given me, believe me to be Sincerely yours James Joyce",
