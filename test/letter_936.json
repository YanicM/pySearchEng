  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am sorry you have had bad news about illness in Miss Marsden’s family but I am glad it is over. We have had a sequence of storms here and I have been dragging on from one week to the next. At last I finished the piece for t.6 and had the MS sent you in two parcels. Please let me know if you get it. No 11 is Y in his know-all profoundly impressive role for which an ‘ever devoted friend’ (so his letters are signed) unrequestedly consented to pose (the appelation ‘darling X’ has also been addressed to me who am hopelessly given to the use of signorial titles). I wanted it as ballast and the whole piece is to balance Yabcd more accurately. I never worked against time in this way or in such troubling conditions. I think it is right enough. Y doctor is a bit husky beside the more melodious Shaun of the third part but the words of Trismegistus are harsh too after the songs of MacCormack…. I wish I could get away. In fact I need months and months of rest as I am wound up. My position is a farce. Picasso has not a higher name than I have, I suppose, and he can get 20,000 or 30,000 francs for a few hours’ work. I am not worth a penny a line and it seems I cannot even sell such a rare book as Dubliners (Dublin). Of course I have turned down a number of lecture tours in America and refused interviews. I ought to hold on here till spring, I suppose, to see whether the German and French translations come out and how they go if they do. But it becomes more and more of a strain. I know if I go it will collapse…. I am more and more aware of the indignant hostility shown to my experiment in interpreting ‘the dark night of the soul’. The personal rancours of disappointed artists who have wasted their talents or perhaps even their genius while I with poorer gifts and a dreadful lot of physical and mental hardships have or seem to have done something would not apply in your [?my] case…. I saw A.E.’s review of P.P. It is not unfriendly though I doubt if he can like very much verse which is not about an idea. I don’t think reviews mean much always. Not a single notice appeared in the English press yet a London bookseller ordered 850 copies a few days ago and Dublin took 250. I saw orders from Naples, The Hague, Budapest etc. I suppose on certain types it will make the same impression as its author at the suppertable. One lady who came to pray remained to scoff. ‘He looked as if he were drowned’ she remarked. Et ça m’est parfaitement égal…. As to ‘Phoenix’. A viceroy who knew no Irish thought this was the word the Dublin people used and put up the mount of a phoenix in the park. The Irish was fiunishgue = clear water from a well of bright water there.",
