  "text": "Dear Stannie, I sent you on Monday 53 Lire and the sending of it cost nearly another lira to say nothing of the fact that I had to go in and out of about ten cafés, to get gold and silver, as there is an intelligent rule here in the P.O. which prohibits the payment of international M.O.’s in paper. Georgie seems better at last. His medicines and doses went up to about 5 lire and I bought a bottle of some tonic for Nora. The landlady very kindly has raised my rent to 40 lire and my pupil has gone away until December next. I had also to pay him 11 lire that I borrowed from him and as he seemed a decent little fellow (he is a nephew of the Abruzzese painter, Michetti. Francini’ll tell you who he is) I asked him to dine with us on Michaelmas evg. We had a roast duck. Now about G.R. I have not replied to his letter. I wrote to Symons narrating the case from the beginning and asking for his advice. I went also to Wyndham. Early in the conversation, talking of nothing in particular, he told me that he and his wife neither visited nor received visits. His wife who is English is very exclusive and won’t know any English people she meets abroad. Her grandfather was an admiral. She knows, he told me, many of the aristocracy of Rome and now they don’t go to the Embassy any more. He hates Rome and is very fond of Naples: but he prefers Booloinsoormer. He made some courageous attempts to pronounce the names of one or two of the principal streets in this city where he has lived for eighteen years. He always tells the Romans to their face what he thinks of them and he says the Italians are most ungrateful. I will find them out, he says. He says that talking of Ald. Kelly and the Union Jack, the Irish are really very disloyal, very disloyal. He has a Union Jack furled in his hall. He hangs it out on all his Majesty’s or her Majesty’s feast-days. Some people ask him why he doesn’t hang it out on the Italian King’s feast-day. But you won’t catch him doing that, he says. I argued with him politely for an hour and a quarter. He offered me neither a cigarette, nor a biscuit nor a glass of wine nor yet a glass of water. At the door he told me the Italians were quite uncivilised. I would find them out. I at once found out a trattoria where I commanded a quite uncivilised youth to bring me instantly a quarter of wine and cast proudly on the table three halfpence. The youth murmured his thanks and some quite uncivilised men saluted me humbly as I strode out of the shop. I refrained from telling them to their faces what I thought of them but as I strode homeward I came carefully to the conclusion that Wyndham is probably the most stupid, prosy, old, bastard at present living in this city. I went to the English consul, who gave me the address of an international jurist, Mr St Lo Malet. This latter read all the letters and the contract and I expect will send me his bill. He discovered some discrepancies. First GR says ‘I read the book myself on behalf of this house’: later ‘the man who read your book for us was Filson Young’. He says an agreement like mine is considered only a personal contract. He advised me to try to come to terms on letter 11 and not to go to law (Letter 11 is the letter with which G.R. returned the MS) as lawsuits are long, and costly and as other publishers would then be reluctant to publish me. I said I had tried to come to terms on letter 11 unsuccessfully. I told him I had written to Symons and he advised me to wait for Symons’ answer before doing anything. He gave me the address of The Incorporated Soc. of Authors. He distrusts the word Incorporated which he says probably means that they are slow to move. In one way he says my case is strong since G.R. has broken the contract. But he says the assessment of damages would be very difficult. G.R. has constantly disparaged the book commercially. The contract gave me nothing on the 1st 500 and G.R. could maintain that it was unlikely my book would reach even that limit. I might be awarded £5–0–0 damages or enough money to enable me to bring out the book myself. What do you think of his opinion? I am still waiting for S to answer and have not replied to G.R. I replied today to Gogarty’s card: felicitated him on his good news whatever it might be and reminding him that the last night I met him in Nassau Street he had also good news which he asked me to go and hear. I sent him no news of my own and said I saw little profit in our exchanging any more curt notes. I regret to see he has not continued his Ugly England yet. I would fain hear more about the slattern comediennes—renegade artist that I am. Starkey writes two little immortal things in Sinn Féin about a Fiddler and (damme if I can think of the other) a Piper, I think. AE ought now to write some little immortal dreamy thing about a Trombonist or, better, a Triangle-Player. I wish some unkind person would publish a book about the venereal condition of the Irish; since they pride themselves so much on their immunity. It must be rather worse than England, I think. I know very little of the subject but it seems to me to be a disease like any other disease, caused by anti-hygienic conditions. I don’t see where the judgment of God comes into it nor do I see what the word ‘excess’ means in this connection. Perhaps Gogarty has some meaning of his own for this word. I would prefer the unscientific expression ‘venereal ill-luck’. Am I the only honest person that has come out of Ireland in our time? How dusty their phrases are! Georgie now walks about all the day by himself. He doesn’t seem to be so fat as he was but I suppose his cold accounts for that. He has not been out for ten days. He has a huge appetite. He makes nothing of a handful of grapes. As it is too cold in the evening now we have our dinner sent to the house. I am looking out for a little quarter and will get some furniture on hire as it is stupid to continue paying this rent for such a room as ours. I will try for one near the Pantheon where the streets are wooden as the late King is buried there. I wish they had buried a few more monarchs or emperors in the neighbourhood as the cobbled streets are fearfully noisy. Rome must have been a fine city in the time of Caesar. I believe it was chiefly on one or two hills: the inter spaces being used as military exercise-grounds, market-places &c. The forum must have been a magnificent square. But the papal Rome is like the Coombe or old Trieste and the new Ludovisi quarter is like any secondary quarter of a fine metropolis. Not as fine as Pembroke township, for example. I wish I knew something of Latin or Roman History. But it’s not worth while beginning now. So let the ruins rot. Two things are excellent in Rome: air and water. Jim PS I refrain from intruding the Lsd question until I write you on Sunday. I want you to get your wind again. Jim",
