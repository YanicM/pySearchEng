  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: Thanks for the sheets of Barrie’s Ibsen’s Ghosts and for leave to keep them. It is an amusing burlesque which would have made old Henrik laugh. I saw J.L. Toole act twice and he must have been droll and completely improbable in the part. As my Epilogue will be printed in H. Gorman’s biography of me I thought of letting him see the sheets. There is a certain limit. J.M.B. in his preface alludes to Ibsen as ‘the greatest dramatist of our age’. I would go much further. But I note there are only 16 copies not for sale of this as yet unpublished ‘work’ and perhaps you may not wish me to send this to the U.S.A. even as a brief temporary loan. It is by no means necessary that I should do so.? Sincerely yours James Joyce",
