  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards, I hardly know what you wish me to write as a description of the book. I sketched it for you in former letters but perhaps you want a complete description. The only thing I could think of was to ask my brother to write a short account of the book and this I now enclose you. It expresses my aim very well and you are free to use it as well as any notice of your own which seems to you suitable. Naturally you know better than I what is needed. As for the appearance of the book I am content to leave it to your judgment. I have no books here to select from, my library being composed mainly of bundles of old letters. I would not like the book to be too slim in form. If you send me in your reply to this details of, say, two styles of binding I will choose one of them. On one point I would wish you to be careful. I would like the printer to follow the manuscript accurately in punctuation and arrangement. Inverted commas for instance, to enclose dialogue always seemed to me a great eyesore. I doubt if June would be a good time to publish the book. I would prefer some date early in May or, if that be not possible, September. You have asked me to tell you what I am doing and what my prospects are. I am an English teacher here in a Berlitz School. I have been here for sixteen months during which time I have achieved the delicate task of living and of supporting two other trusting souls on a salary of £80 a year. I am employed to teach young men of this city the English language as quickly as possible with no delays for elegance and receive in return tenpence for every sixty minutes so spent. I must not omit to mention that I teach also a baroness. My prospects are the chance of getting money enough from my book or books to enable me to resume my interrupted life. I hope these details will not bore you as much as they bore me. In any case I give them to you only because you have asked me for them. I return you the contract signed by me. I hope you will write to me as soon as possible so that the date of appearance and form of the book may be soon agreed on. I have sent you a story Two Gallants and propose adding one more story to the book. I have written part of it and can promise that it will be ready during March. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
