  "text": "Dear Stannie: Thanks for the two books. I have looked here and there through one G di D. I wanted them chiefly for the files. They have played me the same trick as Roth and the Japanese (20000 copies of U in Japanese sold in Japan in 6 months): but there is nothing to be done. So the Tokyo lawyer says. The best thing in the O.U.P. book is Bliss. J.S.’s poem is good too. I should have gone to Zurich today but have to put it off, being slightly grippé. Hope to go next week. I have to see Vogt 3 times a year circa. My case is on in the U.S.A. and am expecting a cable every day. Meanwhile H.H. has given me a cross. This blessing is valid. ‘Quaecumque benedixerunt, benedicantur.’—but only, I think, for that copy and that reader. Buon pro gli faccia! France has become very dear with the paralysed £ at 78 but I suppose one has to pay a premium for this district. The grandson is hale and hearty. A man named Michelesse (?) called here. I had no book to give his firm, of course. He seems all right but what a funny lingo he speaks! Why not write direct to Putnam’s? The manager, Huntington, is very agreeable. It is only the usual woolliness of English publishers. I had a letter from Poppie. She was operated, the usual thing, I expect, but is now better. Did you get your teeth seen to? You should. You will feel much better afterwards. Budgen has done a book on me, with drawings. You will get a copy. As for Gorman, spurlos verschwunden, Best wishes to you both from all the six J’s Jim",
