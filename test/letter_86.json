  "text": "Dear Stannie Please send me my chapters back at once. In a few days you will receive fifty copies of The Holy Office and in a fortnight the University College episode of eleven chapters. I have offered my book of verse to John Lane. Why the devil donâ€™t you write? You know the martyrdom my life is here and its dullness. I think the title of the novel is justified. I wish you could get on to a boat and work out here for even a week. I have changed the scope of the novel very much and intend to rewrite some of the beginning which, I think is not well written. I am going to the conservatory about my voice. Randegger is a Trieste man. I think I have done a great deal during the last seven months but yet I have not satisfied myself. Jim",
