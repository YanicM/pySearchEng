  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am overwhelmed by works and worries. I enclose proofs of The Giant’s Howe which I hope will please you better in print. Two curious things. Huddleston told me he is of Scandinavian stock and was born in Barrow-in-Furness, where there is a giant’s mound. A Chinese student sent me some letterwords I had asked for. The last one is K. It means ‘mountain’ and is called ‘Chin’, the common people’s way of pronouncing Hin or Fin. My desk is loaded with German proofs of U. I am trying to get people to read them. I had to revise K and read it again for the editors of Transition. They liked it so much that they want the suite for the April number and will then reprint May to July the Criterion, This Quarter, and Navire so as to publish seriatim all Part I. I am working away at the suite of K. French and German papers published the protest. English and American mostly not: libellous they call it. However an English paper Humanist has been found which will print it with facsimile of signatures photographed…. Somebody has taken from the works at Dijon the complete final proofs of U corrected by me copiously and signed by Miss Beach and me (her property) and a dealer here is offering them for sale. Mr Darantière has been telegraphed for. New letter from Roth’s lawyer and new cable from another lawyer saying he can stop publication of U if I wire authorising him…. I gave the set of verses to MacLeish, a young and talented American poet, to read. Five minutes rest here! Next stop Humphreystown!",
