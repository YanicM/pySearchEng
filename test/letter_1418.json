  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: Thanks for your letter and kind proposal which we can talk about if, as I hope, we see you on your way through here. 17 March is S. Patrick’s Day and we expect to be here in Paris. I enclose a leaflet about F.W. I find the price of the ordinary edition too high but can do nothing about it. Who has Prof. Fehr’s place as Professor of English at Z’ch University now? Can you find out? A bientôt from us both. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
