  "text": "Dear Stannie, I have been expecting a letter from you this long time. I have had no reply either from Aunt J or from Symons. There was a Jewish divorce case on last week in Dublin which would have interested me very much but of course nobody thought of sending me a paper. I have received Sinn Féin and The Leprechaun. The editor of S.F alludes to the British army as the only mercenary army in Europe. I suppose he prefers the conscription system because it is French. Irish intellectuals are very tiresome. Italy, at least, has two things to balance its miserable poverty and mismanagement: a lively intellectual movement and a good climate. Ireland is Italy without these two. I see that the Irish National Theatre season is on at present: a triple bill of which the good Lady Gregory supplies two items. A play by a man named William Boyle makes the dramatic critic of S.F. think of Ibsen. I am reading another book by Gissing The Crown of Life. Here are two samples of his way of writing ‘’Arry, in fact, to use a coarse but expressive phrase, was a hopeless blackguard’ ‘When he left, which he did later in the day (to catch a train) the conversation resumed its usual course &c’. His books remind me of what Effore calls Pastefazoi? I perceive that my first opinion of him was founded on pure good nature, nothing else. After all, I can read anything. I am reading every day the feuilleton in the Daily Mail the name of which is The Swelling of Jordan. I see that John Dillon at the Galway election alluded to Capt. Shawe Taylor as a bastard and a blackguard. Note the discrimination. I thought of beginning my story Ulysses: but I have too many cares at present. Ferrero devotes a chapter in his history of Rome to the Odes of Horace: so, perhaps, poets should be let live. In his book Young Europe which I have just read he says there are three great classes of emigrants: the (I forget the word: it means conquering, imposing their own language, &c), the English: the adhesive (forming a little group with national traditions and sympathies) the Chinese and the Irish!!!!: the diffusive (entering into the new society and forming part of it) the Germans. He has a fine chapter on Antisemitism. By the way, Brandes is a Jew. He says that Karl Marx has the apocalyptic imagination and makes Armageddon a war between capital and labour. The most arrogant statement made by Israel so far, he says, not excluding the gospel of Jesus is Marx’s proclamation that socialism is the fulfilment of a natural law. In considering Jews he slips in Jesus between Lassalle and Lombroso: the latter too (Ferrero’s father-in-law) is a Jew. We got notice yesterday. So I have to look for another room. Tomorrow my money will be all gone. I am relying on a pupil who begins lessons tonight. He is taking 10 lessons for 20 lire. I have made out a receipt but perhaps he will have no money with him (he does not come again till Saturday) or will not like to pay in advance. I cannot press him as he is a friend of a clerk in the bank who recommended him to me. I will find it very hard to get a room such as we want. I must be out by the end of the month: and I will have also to pay the Caparra, I answered two advts for lessons. One of them I missed by a post; the advertiser wrote to thank me and said he had just given his word. If I went to the café I should have seen the paper in time but I wait to read it in the bank. To economise we have given up drinking wine at lunch. But even then we would not live on Lire 25 a week. I gave Nora first L50 and then L20 and on that we have managed 15 days only: that is, about L32 a week. We have still left coal and a little oil and sugar and coffee: and owe nothing. But the position is again exciting. You can see how impossible it is for me to write or do anything in such circumstances. I had about 82 lire over clear: I gave 10 to the barrister and around 70 to Nora. The other two I spent partly on—cakes! (I did so to test the truth of one of Ferrero’s statements about English and Italian cakes and biscuits). I will wait until tonight before posting this. Last night I went into an evangelical hall. The minister was English. Is it affectation or impotence of the English that they can make no attempt to pronounce any language but their own. He spoke fluently and correctly enough but it had no resemblance to Italian in sound. I can easily distinguish the English accent, talking Italian. Candidly, I don’t know whether they assume it or not. Their accent speaking English (particularly that of the women) is very pleasant and modulated compared with the Irish or American accent or the Scotch accent. The American accent is really bloody fearful to listen to. By the way, one of the little illusions which gladden the heart of the staff of Sinn Féin is that the English don’t know how to pronounce their own language. When an English tourist meets Che Buono the latter sneers at him because he says ‘Haw, I cawn’t heawh wot youah saying’, but he forgets his compatriot, who in Dick Sheehy’s story, after ranging the hotel burst in on the dinner-table, holding up his trousers and asked earnestly ‘For the love o’ Jaysus, gintlemin, will ye tell us where’s the convaynience’. By the way, they are still at the ‘venereal excess’ cry in Sinn Féin. Why does nobody compile statistics of ‘venereal excess’ from Dublin hospitals. What is ‘venereal excess’? Perhaps Mr Skeffington-Sheehy could write something on the subject, being, as J.J.B. puts it ‘a pure man’. ‘Infant Jesus, meek and mild, Pity me a little child. Make me humble as thou art, And with Thy love inflame my heart’. Anyway my opinion is that if I put down a bucket into my own soul’s well, sexual department, I draw up Griffith’s and Ibsen’s and Skeffington’s and Bernard Vaughan’s and St. Aloysius’ and Shelley’s and Renan’s water along with my own. And I am going to do that in my novel (inter alia) and plank the bucket down before the shades and substances above mentioned to see how they like it: and if they don’t like it I can’t help them. I am nauseated by their lying drivel about pure men and pure women and spiritual love and love for ever: blatant lying in the face of the truth. I don’t know much about the ‘saince’ of the subject but I presume there are very few mortals in Europe who are not in danger of waking some morning and finding themselves syphilitic. The Irish consider England a sink: but, if cleanliness be important in this matter, what is Ireland? Perhaps my view of life is too cynical but it seems to me that a lot of this talk about love is nonsense. A woman’s love is always maternal and egoistic. A man, on the contrary, side by side with his extraordinary cerebral sexualism and bodily fervour (from which women are normally free) possesses a fund of genuine affection for the ‘beloved’ or ‘once beloved’ object. I am no friend of tyranny, as you know, but if many husbands are brutal the atmosphere in which they live (vide Counterparts) is brutal and few wives and homes can satisfy the desire for happiness. In fact, it is useless to talk about this any further. I am going to lunch. Have just received your letter. Facts are, as you surmise. We have now Tuesday 13th 4 o’clock less than 3 lire. Tonight at 8 o’clock my pupil comes. I shall try him but may fail. If I fail I am in the usual fix. You ask me to scan verses. What verses? Whose verses? You ask me to explain ‘the Marquis of Lorne’. Uncle John; who was considered like the Marquis of Lorne is the person alluded to. The meaning of Dublin by Lamplight Laundry? That is the name of the laundry at Ballsbridge, of which the story treats. It is run by a society of Protestant spinsters, widows, and childless women—I expect—as a Magdalen’s home. The phrase Dublin by Lamplight means that Dublin by lamplight is a wicked place full of wicked and lost women whom a kindly committee gathers together for the good work of washing my dirty shirts. I like the phrase because ‘it is a gentle way of putting it’. Now I have explained. Please explain you what means ‘I shall take my time about answering’ re Aunt J’s letter. I was today in the Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele, looking up the account of the Vatican Council of 1870 which declared the infallibility of the Pope. Had not time to finish. Before the final proclamation many of the clerics left Rome as a protest. At the proclamation when the dogma was read out the Pope said ‘Is that all right, gents?’. All the gents said ‘Placet’ but two said ‘Non placet’. But the Pope ‘You be damned! Kissmearse! I’m infallible!’. The two were, according to one account, the bishops of Capuzzo and Little Rock, according to another account, the bishops of Ajaccio and Little Rock. I looked up MacHale’s life. He was bishop of Tuam and of somewhere else in partibus. They say nothing of his having voted at the Vatican Council. I shall continue there tomorrow and rewrite that part of the story. Grace takes place in 1901 or 2, therefore Kernan at that time 1870 would have been about twenty-five. He would have been born in 1848 and would have been only 6 years of age at time of the proclamation of the Immaculate Conception dogma 1854. I want now an account of the unveiling of Smith O’Brien’s statue to see if MacHale was there. I can get all the dictionaries I want in the Bib. Vitt. Eman. (blast the long name) including a diet of English slang. What a pity I am so handicapped. Eglinton was sure I would come back begging to Dublin and J.J.B. that I would become a drunkard and Cosgrave that I would become a nymphomaniac. Alas, gentlemen, I have become a bank clerk, and, now that I think of it, bad as it is, it’s more than either of my three prophets could do. How do you like the name for the story about Hunter? I am very pleased with your admiration for Swift. I suppose I shall get interested in him some day. But I prefer people who are alive. Sometimes when I am on the track of some idea and am about to burst into speech I hear a voice ‘Signor Joyce, scriva a questo signore, in francese, dicendogli che abbiamo venduto ventimila peseta———’ You remember the book I spoke to you of one day in the Park into which I was going to put William Dara and Lady Belvedere. Even then I was on the track of writing a chapter of Irish history. I wish I had a map of Dublin and views and Gilbert’s history. But nobody, except you, seems to take me seriously. I paid Shelley’s granddaughter or grand-niece £10–0–0 the other day. Her name is Nora. She is left-handed. This is the way Leonardo wrote his notes, I am afraid—not left-handed, of course, but in this jerky way. I would like to write The Last Supper about Joe MacKernan—ought I? Mother said I was a ‘mocker’. Am I? It is now 6 o’clock. At 8 o’clock I will try the pupil. Write soon. Jim I got 20 lire from my pupil, so that I can manage until Saturday. But while I am looking for another pupil you had better try to send me some. Remember I have to live and get a room. [Postscript at head of letter] I think the respondent is old Harris, the jeweller, of Nassau Street, from whose grandson Sinclair I raised 10/– at the time of my hegira. By the bye, about the money I got on the 1st of Nov. L50 to Eng Consul, L52 for landlady, L70 to Nora, L10 to barrister, L30 to lunchman, L30 for Nora’s and Georgie’s clothes and hat and boots—that makes L245.—.",
