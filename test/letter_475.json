  "text": "Dear Mr Sykes: Just got your card. Show MS at once to Mr G and explain to him that it can be typed quickly while the sale or otherwise of his business is pending. That much at least should be done at once. In the other two episodes (which are not long) it will depend on whether he disposes of his place or not. I take it you could do what I send quickly. There is no use losing time. Errors: for ‘old shrunken breasts’ in description of the old milkwoman read ‘old shrunken paps’. For ‘plunged’ in description of Buck Mulligan searching trunk for handkerchief read ‘plunged and rummaged’.",
