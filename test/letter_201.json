  "text": "Dear Sir I am much honoured by your setting of my five songs and thank you for sending me a copy of the music. I hope you will find a good singer for them as your music needs to be well sung. Some cadences in the last song (which pleases me best) remind me of an Irish air ‘Billy Byrne of Ballymanus’. I admire also the setting of the parentheses in the first one and the way you reproduce the changes of stress in the second one. It seems to me a pity you did not do the song ‘Bid adieu’ which I tried to music myself and hope you may turn to it some day. Should the songs be sung I should be glad if you would kindly let me know of their success. Thanking you very sincerely for your kind thought I am, Faithfully Yours James Joyce",
