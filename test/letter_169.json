  "text": "Dear Stannie Tonight at 6.30 while I was sitting at my desk in the bank I heard a loud explosion and felt the house shake. A few minutes after I heard people running under the windows ‘Bomba! Bomba!’ A bomb had exploded at the Caffè Aragno which is at the corner of our palace. Have not yet seen the papers. The street is full of people and strewn with broken cups. Item. I am sick in my cor cordium. Nice country! [Unsigned] Hope you will be able to come to the rescue on Sat.",
