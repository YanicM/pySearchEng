  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I enclose the translation of Mr Angeli’s review. Perhaps you could send him a copy of the paper when published. He wrote to me a few weeks ago that he is going to Rome where his address will be c/o Giornale d’Italia, piazza Sciarra, I believe. As soon as Chamber Music arrives I shall return it signed. The first episode of Ulysses was sent to Mr Pound a fortnight ago in two copies. The second I shall send tomorrow. The third which completes the first part early in January when it is typed. I should like to have a copy of the second edition of my novel. A very dreadful pen! so I shall conclude by hoping you got my good wishes for Xmas and by thanking you for your kind message also.",
