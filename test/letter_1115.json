  "text": "Dear Larbaud: Lucia had a bad crise de nerfs at the Gare du Nord so I had to take the trunks off the train, abandon our journey to London and definitely give up my Kensington flat. So here we are in a hotel again, after 12 years in Paris! I talked about you a few days ago at lunch with de Lanux who is having a show here of his soldiers. The enclosed bêtise, written only for the sake of the rhymes, is the result. Thanks for the print. I had it framed in silver. I am sending this to your country address though you seem to be cruising in the mezzogiorno. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
