  "text": "Dear Stannie Your wire arrived at 6. I asked you to wire before lunch so that I might have it early, as I feared the P.O. here might be shut. I received 31.40 lire. I suppose it cost you the difference between that and 40.0 to wire it. I wired you at 8.45 a.m. When did you get it? I shall leave discussion of money matters until arrival of your letter which I expect tomorrow. No advt from Gogarty. I suppose his writing to me was some drunken freak. I suppose he wouldn’t dare present me to his wife. Or does the poor mother accompany them on the honeymoon? I suspect she is not a tocharless lass. I set the fashion, it seems. W.B. Yeats ought to hurry up and marry Lady Gregory—to kill talk: and Colm ought to propose to his roselike Miss Esposito. I have just finished Dorian Grey [sic]. Some chapters are like Huysmans, catalogued atrocities, lists of perfumes and instruments. The central idea is fantastic. Dorian is exquisitely beautiful and becomes awfully wicked: but never ages. His portrait ages. I can imagine the capital which Wilde’s prosecuting counsel made out of certain parts of it. It is not very difficult to read between the lines. Wilde seems to have had some good intentions in writing it—some wish to put himself before the world—but the book is rather crowded with lies and epigrams. If he had had the courage to develop the allusions in the book it might have been better. I suspect he has done this in some privately-printed books. Like his Irish imitator: Quite the reverse is The style of his verses. Can you tell me what is a cure for dreaming? I am troubled every night by horrible and terrifying dreams: death, corpses, assassinations in which I take an unpleasantly prominent part. As for my health I eat well. Last night we ate an entire roast chicken and a plateful of ham, bread and wine—and went to bed hungry. I am going to take lessons in Danish from the 1st Sept. I have met a Dane here—one Pedersen—and, as he can’t talk Italian we mumble German mixed with Danish at each other. I wonder when learning it is it necessary to keep a good-sized potato in each cheek. You said it was like a nigger speaking German but it is more like Mr O’Connell (Bill) speaking Dutch. I cannot write to G.R. until I know whether this will be my address next month. Wyndham said ‘for the month of August’. Hard work in the bank. On Friday I did not get out till about 8.30. The correspondence reaches about 200 to 250 letters a day. The latest news is that the seat is out of my trousers. How the devil did you think the news about Kettle would interest me. But I would like to see a copy of Dialogues of the Day. I have written three paragraphs to add to A Painful Case, but I don’t know if I can rewrite it. I would like also to rewrite After the Race but if G.R. sent me the proofs I would pass the book as it is. The chase of perfection is very unprofitable. Send me on the news. Today I discovered a photograph of Billy Walsh exposed in a prominent street. Would you like to see some copies of L’Asino—the Italian anti-clerical newspaper. I absorbed the attention of the three clerks in my office a few days ago by a socialistic outburst. One of them is a German and he was ridiculing Lombrosianism and antimilitarism. He said when children cried they ‘should be caned’, favoured corporal punishment in schools, conscription, religion &c. I think he was surprised not to find an ally in an Inglese. Item: English and Americans abroad talk at the top of their voices. Nora has a talent for blowing soap-bubbles. While I was wading through a chapter of Dorian Gray a few days ago she and Georgie were blowing bubbles on the floor out of a basin of suds. She can make them as big as a football. Georgie is a great favourite with everyone here. All the people we frequent know his name. He has added to his vocabularv ‘O Gesù Mio’ ‘Brutto, brutto, brutto’ and cleans out his ear when told to do so. Also when we go to the band in Piazza Colonna he beats time to the music, amusing the ‘smiling Romans’ thereby very much. He wears a long mayoral chain with little medals round his neck. By the way, if you come to Rome before Xmas, I will buy a goose for 3 lire and have it cooked where we go for dinner. Have you seen that there is a split in the socialistic camp here between Ferri and your friend Labriola? Only that money is so ‘skinty’ (a word of Alice’s making) I would have bought Rosa Bernd today. If you buy The Lake you might send it to me. Unfortunately all the English libraries are shut now or I would join one. I think I will learn Danish rapidly with this Pedersen chap. In one restaurant we go to Georgie sits sedately at the top of the table in a little high chair of his own and announces to the restaurant the arrival of each of our dishes by shouting ‘Ettero, Ettero’. When we were in S. Peter’s he began to shout ‘Iga, Iga’ immediately when the lazy whores of priests began to chant. Would you like any picture postcards of Rome? Jim. Nora says she is asking for you. If there is anything interesting (Ferrerò etc) in the Piccolo della Sera, you might send it.",
