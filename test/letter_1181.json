  "text": "Dear Eliot: Thanks for your letter but the U.S. ban does not ‘seem’ to be lifted. It is lifted. I have here counsel’s brief (100 printed pp) and the judge’s ruling, about 12 pages. He states that his ruling is as legally valid as a decision by judge and jury, both parties having agreed to have the case tried before him alone. He orders that his ruling be filed. Three-fourths of the text was published in the N.Y. Herald Tribune of 7 December. The U.S. attorney-general, immediately after the decision, stood up and said he accepted the judge’s ruling with great satisfaction and that the state would not appeal from it to a higher court. The defendant, Cerf, then said he would publish the book with an account of the proceedings (I suppose like the édition définitive of Madame Bovary) on 19 January next. My solicitors don’t understand very clearly why they were written to. No more do I. I told you I am the absolute owner of the copyright and property rights in England. En somme, one half of the English-speaking world has given in. The other half, after a few terrifying bleats from Leo Britannicus, will follow—as it always does. I am sorry you are not coming over. Anyhow I wish you a happy Xmas and good luck in the coming year. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
