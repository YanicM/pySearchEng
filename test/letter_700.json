  "text": "Dear McAlmon: I send back your article—many thanks. I corrected the title of Flaubert’s book in it and added a footnote—Miss Beach’s address. She doesn’t know what paper it could go to and as it’s all about ME I can’t send it anywhere myself. What about Broom? The editor Loeb is in Paris, I hear. I suppose the Gargoyle is useless. As regards Dial Pound, Eliot and Colum are all doing or have done articles in it so I fancy they are full up. A new number of The Tyro is out but a review to be of service to me should appear shortly. I suppose your father-in-law could not place it anywhere? The 150 franc edition is out of print, there remain only 250 and 350 francs copies. Matters are in a dreadful tangle with Darantière however. We can’t get press copies out of him and Miss Beach leaves for Dijon tonight. I have not had a day’s peace since the book came out. If the press copies came and if the rest of the edition were quickly disposed of accounts would be settled up quickly and I could at last lie back. As it is Miss B. the Greek girl and I make frantic endeavours to hasten that consummation. I will send any other notice I get. Let me know what you do with the notice. Thanks for sending it. It’s all right. Are there any 250 or 350 fr candidates down there? Sincerely yours James Joyce",
