  "text": "My dear Mr Healy: May I ask you as a favour to forward the enclosed letter and the copy of the review which I am also sending? I cannot find Mr Boyd’s address in Who’s Who? He used to live in Kildare Street 41, 43, 47 etc and was connected with New Ireland (the review not the weekly). If you read the letter you will see what it is about. If Mr Boyd’s address is not in Thom’s perhaps you could telephone to New Ireland offices or to your friend in Combridge’s as Mr Boyd appears to be the semi-official historian of the Irish literary movement I presume they will know his address. If not the only thing to do is to forward letter and review to him c/o his London publishers whoever they are. Many thanks in advance and renewed good wishes for the New Year, the Devil being requested by me to take the present one as quickly as he likes.",
