  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards I am anxious to hear from you about my books. It is nearly two months since I sent you Dubliners and I have now added another story to it, Two Gallants. I suppose the general election postpones some of your plans. But I think that my country is likely to be discussed now and this fact might make Dubliners timely. I hope you will let me know as soon as you can what decision you have come to. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
