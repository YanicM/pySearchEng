  "text": "Dear Mr Bergan, This is the only way I can invite you to drink to both our healths this Christmas so please let it pass. We are still detained here and cannot return to Paris till after New Year. I hope you are in good health and spirits. Giorgio (my son) gave his first concert over the radio in New York a week ago and he too will not be back in Paris till the Spring. MacCormack says he has a magnificent bass. How glad Pappie would have been of this. There have been voices on both sides of our family for several generations, but nobody ever really made a career out of it. McGuckin used to say Pappie had the best tenor voice in Ireland in his time. You never heard him at his best. He had a voice very like that of Jean de Reszke. We used to have merry evenings in our house, used we not? In answer to your question. No, I am not interested in Irish Sweepstake tickets. I suppose the staircases in all the hospitals in Dublin are now made of solid gold. The only decent people I ever saw at a racecourse were the horses. The late Shah of Persia when invited by King Edward to go to Goodwood replied: I know that one horse runs quicker than than [sic] another but which particular horse it is doesnâ€™t interest me. With all good wishes to you for a merry Xmas and a happy New Year and with friendly remembrances sincerely yours James Joyce",
