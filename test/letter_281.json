  "text": "Dear Aunt Lillie We are all greatly shocked and grieved to hear of Uncle John’s sudden death and I trust you will allow me to offer you in the name of all here our sincere sympathy with you in your sorrow. We do not wish to intrude on your grief but hope that when you can find the heart to do so you will perhaps write to tell us something more as the short note this morning told us nothing and we did not even know that he had been ill. For my own part allow me to say that I am very sorry indeed to hear of my poor uncle’s death. Everybody in this world has a different point of view and so we are often estranged to a certain extent from one another. But I am very glad to remember his friendliness to me and my little son and his courteous hospitality to both of us. I wish to say that Stannie and Eileen and Eva unite their condolences with mine and will write to you also themselves. Jim",
