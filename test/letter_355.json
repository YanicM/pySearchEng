I do not know when your letter was written but, if a long time has passed, beg you to excuse my seeming discourtesy. I am obliged by Mr H.G. Wellsâ€™ kindness and also by the friendly interest you express. Would it be too much trouble for you to write a line to Mr Ezra Pound? His address is: 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, London, W. He writes to me to say that if you do he will interview you on my behalf and give you all the information you need. You will understand also, from what he will tell you, that it will be impossible for me for some time to go to London but any letter addressed to me at above address will be forwarded to me as soon as possible.",
