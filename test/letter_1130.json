  "text": "Dear Gilbert: I showed Beckett’s acrostic to Mr and Mrs Jolas. The latter thought it poor, the former thinks it acid and not funny. I think it is all right—though if I may suggest anything it seems to me ‘tickled to death’ is better than ‘giggling to death’ though the ‘g’ is nearer ‘j’. The news about Lucia was satisfactory enough till today when she announces her arrival here with the nurse next Friday. I wish she would stay where she is. I have written to Dr Codet about her as, of course, I am nervy all the time at having taken her out of his hands on my own responsibility. The news about my right eye is bad. I have not gone back to Vogt. He says I should have left other things aside and come to him before. How can I possibly make an engagement with him now even if he does decide to risk the two difficult operations which he fears he cannot even make? I wrote to Faber and Faber offering to refund them the £150 advance on Work in Progress and scrap the contract. I hate to have this on my mind too. I am proposing to my ‘estate agents’ to pay off the whole of the lease less discount and let the flat furnished for 1 gn. a week and then sell the sticks. Off with my flat, so much for Kensington! I am not surprised McGreevy does not want to write any more about me—especially for nothing. Why should he? Goll’s article is pretty bad but …’s, …’s, …’s, etc. portraits are also bad. As I wrote to Miss Weaver: es tut mir leid aber es ist absolut nichts zu machen. Un chef de rayon à la Samaritaine. Vous désirez, Madame? Blancs, n’est-ce pas? Au fond, dans le petit coin. O pardon, Monsieur le Président, je croyais que vous étiez Madame la Boulangère. Un canon? parfaitement. Suivez-moi par ici! O excusez-moi, mon petit moutard! Je t’ai fait du mal? Laisse-moi te caresser, ça passera. Merdre de merdre, c’est un bouledogue anglais! O ouch! O ouch! Comment, Monsieur le Directeur, mes huit jours? Mais je suis bouleversé. Sapristi! Je viens de renverser la Tour Eiffel des mouchoirs à 2 frs 75! …",
