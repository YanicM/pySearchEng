  "text": "Dear Stannie We arrived here safely this morning and shall probably stay at this address. I have not yet gone to the Berlitz School but am going there in a half an hour. Douce was in Spain on holidays but Riviere was very kind (soixante francs) and wanted me to go back at 3.30 to meet the son of the richest banker in Zürich. Nora, however, felt naturally very lonely whenever I was away and besides her boot was pinching her. So I let the matter rest. Write here and give me detailed accounts of all the news. Devan came on the boat afterwards and caught us together so perhaps it is public property now. She has written to her mother from Paris a delightfully vague postcard. Has she been advertised for in the papers in Dublin? If anything has come for me send it on here. I met Curran and Murnaghan in Paris but really feared to do anything so hardy. If any money comes for me between this and Saturday wire it on here. I hope you sent the key to Rivière. I called to see Symons but failed. Jim Send on my B.A. certificate and registration for me. Go about the highways of the city but not to any of my touched friends and make up £1 before Saturday which send me on that day without fail. Say nothing of this to Pappie. Finalement, elle n’est pas encore vierge; elle est touchée. Jim",
