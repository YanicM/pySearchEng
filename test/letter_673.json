  "text": "Dear McAlmon: A few lines to say that I have just finished the Ithaca episode so that at last the writing of Ulysses is finished. I have still a lot of proofreading and revising to do but the composition is at an end. I shall send you Penelope with all my revisions and additions when the printers send it back. Ithaca is very strange. I wonder will you like it. O, Deo Gratias! I shall be greatly obliged if your monthly cheque arrives punctually on the 1 Nov (that is to say the damned landlord of this brothel will). Let us hope things will now begin to brighten. About 3 weeks more stewing over proofs and all is finished. So three cheers for Bloom! (Loud hisses) Many apologies for the material part of this and best wishes for your continued magnoliousness and to our next meeting.",
