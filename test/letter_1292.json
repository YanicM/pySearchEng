  "text": "Dear Mr Sullivan: Here is the page signed. It is not easy to sign on Indian paper. If you sign normally the ink spreads. I am late in returning it but the hook-on lens I use for writing was at the opticianâ€™s being mended. I sent you also the disc and impressions of your namesake as promised. I took him to see that film of his native place and he was quite proud and pleased to learn, among other things, that every shebeen in Kerry had a telephone as far back as 1828 when Griffin wrote The Collegians. I hope if this first Irish company screens Marxiana that the name part will be given to a bearded bull. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
