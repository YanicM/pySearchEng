  "text": "Dear Mr Brauchbar: In reply to my two appeals by air mail on 5 August to my two N.Y. publishers for help I received on 28 October through American Export Lines of Marseilles the equivalent of 260$ from one publisher, Huebsch, stated to be the amount due to me on 30 March last. From the other publisher nothing came. The U.S.A. Embassy at Vichy has now reduced the monthly subsidy we live on by 1500 frs. It seems that for one reason or another the subsidy may be further reduced or discontinued in the future. About my daughter I shall write a little later. Now about ourselves. As I told you the German authorities gave me permission to remove my daughter from occupied France. I had arranged for the reception at a Swiss maison de santé in the Vaud, Pré Carré, Corcelles. I then applied to the French Ministry of the Interior for permission for us, my wife, son, grandson and myself to leave unoccupied France. This also was granted by an order of the Minister some weeks ago. Our passports are stamped for exit and our luggage all packed also for weeks past. The Swiss authorities however refused to allow any or all of us to enter. Since the end of July last I have been writing letter after letter to different persons in Switzerland and in addition to formal application through the Lyons Swiss consulate placed the matter in the hands of a Geneva lawyer. Yesterday I had a letter from him asking for 200 frs Swiss. The letter states that the case is still in suspense at the Federal Police Offices. Two of my Zurich references Mr and Mrs Giedion trying to find out what this meant went to the Fremdenpolizei where it was found that I was considered by the officials to be … a Jew! Nothing was known there of any guarantee or affidavit by your son to whom I sent several letters but had no reply. I have now had a telegram signed by Giedion and Ruggiero, a Zurich friend of mine of a very modest station of life who is a clerk at the Zurich Kreditanstalt. It reads: ‘Permis séjour obtenable question financière encore en suspens nous correspondons Edmund’. While I am guessing at what this means and waiting for some new objection to be raised by the Federal authorities the time accorded me for leaving France is running out. The gendarmes who came to our lodgings twice last week as they are making a census of British subjects resident in France, while quite polite, expressed surprise that we who had been so insistent on our desire to leave and had obtained ministerial permission to do so were still here. You may be able to draw some conclusions from these facts. If the Swiss should decide to let us in we have now enough to pay our journey to Lausanne or Zurich and our luggage and debts here and arrive in Switzerland with some thousands of French francs over to start with, perhaps 5 or 6. What we get for them in Swiss francs I do not rightly know. Some say 10%, some 7% and some 5%. But we haven’t got them yet. The U.S.A. legation at Berne to which I wrote informs me that when I have established residence in Switzerland by a sworn declaration before a U.S. consul I can receive money from the U.S.A., that is, if anybody sends it. I hope he is right. I send off this letter as you are doubtless expecting one. You can tell Huebsch I got the 260$. When he sends the usual account of sales I shall send the usual formal acknowledgement. With friendly greetings to your good self in any case sincerely yours James Joyce",
