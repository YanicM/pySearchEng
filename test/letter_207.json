  "text": "Dear Stannie, The article on Don Carlos was not inserted. Mr and Mrs Skeffington met me and invited me to their house: I did not go. Russell and McGee came up to me in the street and were very friendly. I went to see Curran and found him looking ugly and disposed to be unfriendly. Kettle is in the country. I have written to him asking him to make an appointment with me. Have got the list of Intermediate Board and will make application in due time. Maunsel and Co—Geo. Roberts and Maunsel Hone. From what I learn Roberts is the person Hone being an Oxford insipid. I called to see Hone: he was in Belfast. I met Roberts in the street and smoothed him down standing him a drink (I took lithia). He is very self-important. I am to meet both of them to know their verdict on Monday next. Have written to the Glasgow branch of Dun’s Review, but got no answer. Best is away: so is Cousins. Here are some opinions of my appearance. Aunt J—lost all boyishness Cosgrave—in splendid health Eglinton—looking very ecclesiastical Gogarty—Jaysus, man, you’re in phthisis. O’Leary Curtis—much more mature Sheehan—very thin Eileen—very foreign-looking Keohler—You look 35 Mrs Skeff—Not a bit changed Skeff—Somewhat blasé. Everybody—Melancholy Russell—Like a man of business. Gogartv met me on Merrion Sq. I passed him. He ran after me and took me by the arm and made a long speech and was very confused. He asked me to go to his house. I went. He made me go in and rambled on. To everything I said ‘You have your life. Leave me to mine’[.] He invited me to go down to Enniskerry in his motor and lunch with him and wife. I declined. I was very quiet and sober. He offered me grog, wine, coffee, tea: but I took nothing. In the end he said, blushing ‘Well do you really want me to go to hell and be damned’. I said T bear you no illwill. I believe you have some points of good nature. You and I of 6 years ago are both dead. But I must write as I have felt’. He said ‘I don’t care a damn what you say of me so long as it is literature’. I said ‘Do you mean that?’ He said ‘I do. Honest to Jaysus. Now will you shake hands with me at least?’ I said ‘I will: on that understanding’. Byrne I have not seen. Arthur Symons has G.P.I.! Synge is said to have been syphilitic, poor man. Tell Nora to write to me Jim",
