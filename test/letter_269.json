  "text": "Dear Stannie, We opened on Monday. Half an hour before an electrician, a Sinn Feiner, recommended by Oâ€™L.C., left us in the lurch and I had to scour Dublin for substitute. I send copies of papers. Go at once to Prezioso, show them and get in a par: I nostri Triestini in Irlanda or like that. A little allusion to me and a little to the enterprise of the proprietors of Edison and Americano (without giving their names) in opening here. Also the copies of P. and P.d.S., which Rebez subscribes for are to be sent after Sunday 26/xii/09 to Giovanni Rebez Cinematograph Volta, Bucarest, Roumania. Poor houses as yet: terrible weather. Jim",
