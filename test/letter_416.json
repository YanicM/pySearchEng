  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am infinitely obliged to you for all the trouble you have taken about my book and I am glad to hear that the matter is now settled at last. I have not received Mr Marshall’s cablegram but I shall write to him as soon as Mr Pound sends me the address in New York. As soon as you have any further news I hope you will let me know as I am very anxious lest there should be any obstacle to this new scheme. I take it the arrangement is that the book is to be printed in full in New York and published there and in London. I do not know where the proofs are to be read. I remember that you were so kind as to promise to read them but will you be able to do so by this new arrangement? Would it help in any way if I read and checked the third, fourth and fifth chapters which I have in the instalments from 1 August 1914 to 1 September 1915? If the printers set from them this would weed out some of the errors but of course not the new ones which they will put in—with the usual number of unnecessary commas and capitals. But it would be almost as much trouble to find the places in the new proofs as the paging would be different. Mr Treharne wrote to me and I answered by return of post as he told me that he was going to America. He has set some verses of mine which Mr Pound printed in his anthology. With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
