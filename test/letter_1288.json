  "text": "Dear Curran: I hear you will go for a holiday on the 17th. Is there any hope of your passing through Paris? If so, tell me the date and I shall be here. I should like very much to meet you. I cannot put into a letter what I want to say. Lucia has had 8 or 9 injections so far. They are unpleasant but the doctor is hopeful of curing her. But though that is the main thing it is not what I want to say. I suppose that if there is any person in Ireland capable of understanding why I am once again in lonely isolation in my view of Lucia … that person can be only you. It is terrible to think of a vessel of election as the prey of impulses beyond its control and of natures beneath its comprehension and, fervently as I desire her cure, I ask myself what then will happen when and if she finally withdraws her regard from the lightning-lit revery of her clairvoyance and turns it upon that battered cabman’s face, the world. Our hope is that the gaiety and gentleness that we always remember will once again be her companions, as they were through her happy childhood but then grown into another and warmer youth. I am enclosing an estimate of the cost of printing Chaucer’s A.B.C. poem to the Madonna with her initials. Their reproduction cannot be done except in France. As you know probably the A.B.C. was translated by him from the French of Guillaume de Guillerville, a monk of the Abbaye de Challis. My friend Louis Gillet of the Revue des Deux Mondes and a son-in-law of René Doumic is at present curator of this Abbaye (now a national monument) and he has written a preface…. Bref, could you write a line to your publishers in London, Sheed and Ward, to see if they would take the matter up with the Obelisk Press? The cost would be 12½% less for Chaucer used 23 not 26 letters which means that Lucia’s lovely ‘U’ will not appear. Of course if they would do the whole cost themselves (the work still being executed in Paris) or go halves so much the better for me for to tell you the truth the medical faculty of half Europe has very considerately and very considerably lightened my bag of marbles to the extent of about £5000 in the last 4½ years and see the result. Un bel niente!… As you put it that way about the odd pound I owe you still I can say nothing but accept. By the way, it may interest you to know that I had a letter from Giorgio telling me there was a memorial broadcast for A.E. Colum spoke and Giorgio sang. They wanted him to sing ‘Believe me if all those endearing young charms’ bedad they did so but sure bejapers he wouldn’t and begorra he wouldn’t sing that fine old memorial service melody Doran’s Ass for the boys and girls and they all listening and waiting with a tear and a smile. I hope you are well yourself and Mrs and Miss Curran. You have all shown the greatest kindness to Lucia and my wife and I and her brother are deeply grateful to you.",
