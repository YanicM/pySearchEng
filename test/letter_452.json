  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I confirm my card of yesterday. To make matters clearer will you please let me hear from you as soon as possible on the points hereunder: i) Exiles: Does Mr Richards agree to publish this play in England not later than 15 November 1917 and to send me full and complete proof? Do I retain by contract the American rights now and can I dispose of them now? Do I retain translation and stage rights? Have you got the typescript back from the Stage Society? If not kindly telephone for it. Was the play definitely refused by the Abbey Theatre? As you wrote me before that you see no prospect for this play in England do you know any dramatic agent who could push it for me I agree that he receive a special commission, separate from yours—or are you willing to work with Mr M.L. Bloom of New York in this matter on the same terms? Is it agreed that I am to receive 12 free copies and that the printing is to be done in accordance with my typescript and not as Mr Richards’ printer chooses? Is there any clause in the contract foreseeing what is to be done in case Mr Richards’ printer declines to set up the play? ii) Dubliners: Is Mr Richards bringing out a second English edition of this book? If so, when? Will he send me a complete proof with my list of corrections of printer’s errors? Will his printer restore the dashes of my MS which he refused to print and replaced by inverted commas? How many books make an edition in Mr Richards’ custom—if that be not a trade secret? Contract: You have written to me several times on what you call the ‘disastrous’ and ‘dreadful’ character of my contract with Mr Richards and ask why I signed it. I signed it in 1914 after a struggle of 9 years for the publication of my book—written in 1905. You will find the story set forth by Mr Pound in The Egoist (14 January 1914). My New York publisher has recently published a pamphlet about it. The book cost me in litigation and trainfare and postal expenses about 3000 francs: it cost me also nine years of my life. I was in correspondence with seven solicitors, one hundred and twenty newspapers, and several men of letters about it—all of whom, except Mr Ezra Pound, refused to aid me. The type of the abortive first English edition (1906) was broken up. The second edition (Dublin 1910) was burnt entire almost in my presence. The third edition (London, 1914) is the text as I wrote it and as I obliged my publisher to publish it after 9 years. Possibly the terms of his contract are unfair. I neither know nor care anything about that matter—so long as he does with the help of his printer the work he undertakes to do for me. Dubliners was refused by forty publishers in the intervals of the events recorded above. My novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was refused by every publisher to whom you offered it and, when The Egoist decided to publish it, about twenty printers in England and Scotland refused to print it. As you know, I suppose, it was printed in America and published in New York in December 1916 and in London in February 1917. The Egoist intends to bring out a second edition in September and as recent regulations seem to stand in the way of importing printed sheets from New York Miss Weaver has found a printer who will print it now after it has been reviewed. At least so she writes me. Royalties: As regards this point I think it is useless to approach Mr Richards. Moreover it is of minor importance. On Chamber Music I received no royalties in 10 years. On Dubliners (in spite of the press notices) I received 2s/6d royalties in 3 years. The sales in the United Kingdom to date of my novel come to about 450 (after the press notices)—equivalent to a sale of about 28 copies in all Switzerland. I am engaged in writing a book (Ulysses) and I want to have Exiles published this autumn so that I may be able to continue to write it. I foresee for it more difficulties. I hope this letter is a complete explanation made as you appear to want. Any further details you will find in Mr Pound’s article. I shall feel obliged if you on your side will send me a prompt and ample reply to the questions I ask as, in consequence of a grave and dangerous illness extending over five months, I find it necessary to simplify my tiresome and unprofitable affairs. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. If Exiles is being set up now the names of the speakers are to be printed in the centre of the page and not at the side. I think the price ought not to be more than 2/– or 2s/6d. I expect also that Mr Richards will allow me to buy as many copies as I wish at trade rates. J.J.",
