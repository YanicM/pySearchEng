  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: These few lines, I hope, find you well. They are just to tell you we started moving our things into the new empty flat I have taken yesterday. 5 rooms, lift, private telephone, chauffage, 4th floor, clear outlook as right opposite is a hotel particulier of 2 storeys. Little or no traffic in the street which has only 12 houses and is not a suite of any other street. It is no 7 rue Edmond Valentin, between avenues Rapp and Bosquet. If you stand at beginning of Av. Bosquet with your back to the river and walk towards Ecole Militaire the 1st street you pass on the right is a section of rue de l’Université. The second is rue Edmond Valentin. That’s it. rent 11,500. I am now the tenant but workmen will be in till end of August, I think. The heating system is being changed on all the floors and we are repapering and cleaning generally. Only one flat on each landing and this cornerless and quite bright. . So that’s that. I hope you will not cable Lucia on the 26th as she does not know yet you are in U.S. The heat here has been filthy (34 in the shade) but I suppose N. Yorkers find that cool. Our plan is to put all the workmen on the job and then leave for Spa (Belgium) perhaps with the Gilberts. The Jolases will be off for the south on the 19th but meanwhile Mrs Jolas had to rush off to Saint Honoré as Tina there has swallowed a hairpin. We hope to have a letter from you in the morning as two big boats got in. Meanwhile I send this off. How is Stevie standing the heat, also his papa and mama. The Baillys are leaving for a Baltic cruise. Yes, thanks, I will take some ice. Tante belle cose a tali belle persone Babbo Ce soir on danse dans les rues!!!",
