All day I hear the noise of waters Making moan, Sad as the sea-bird is when going Forth alone He hears the winds cry to the waters’ Monotone. The grey winds, the cold winds are blowing Where I go; I hear the noise of many waters Far below, All day, all night I hear them flowing To and fro. [Unsigned]",
