  "text": "My dearest Nora By the time you get this you will have received my present and my letter and will have passed your Christmas. Now I want you to get ready for my coming. If nothing extra turns up I leave Ireland on Saturday 1 January at 9.20 p.m. with Eileen, though how or where I am to get the money I don’t know. I hope you have put the posters in the kitchen. I intend to paper it week by week with the programmes. If you could get a few yards of linoleum or even an old carpet and any kind of a brokendown comfortable cheap armchair for the kitchen and a cheap common pair of red curtains I think I would be very comfortable there. Is it at all possible for us to have a bed more? Perhaps Francini would sell us his by the month. I sent you every penny I could spare, dearest, but now I am stranded as the present I gave you, you little nuisance, cost me a terrible lot of soldi. But don’t think I am sorry, darling. I am delighted to have given you something so fine and beautiful. Now, darling, urge on Stannie to help me to get back promptly with Eileen and then we will begin our life together once more. O how I shall enjoy the journey back! Every station will be bringing me nearer to my soul’s peace. O how I shall feel when I see the castle of Miramar among the trees and the long yellow quays of Trieste! Why is it I am destined to look so many times in my life with eyes of longing on Trieste? Darling, when I go back now I want you always to be patient with me. You will find, dear, that I am not a bad man. I am a poor impulsive sinful generous selfish jealous dissatisfied kind-natured poet but I am not a bad deceitful person. Try to shelter me, dearest, from the storms of the world. I love you (do you believe it now, darling?) and O I am so tired after all I have done here that I think when I reach Via Scussa I will just creep into bed, kiss you tenderly on the forehead, curl myself up in the blankets and sleep, sleep, sleep. Darling, I am so glad you like my picture as a child. I was a fierce-looking infant, was I not? And really, dear, I am just as big a child now as I was then. The foolishest things are always coming into my head. You know the picture of the man with his finger up in the Piccolo della Sera which you say is ‘Jim making some new suggestion’. I am sure, darling, in your heart of hearts you must think I am a poor silly boy. You proud little ignorant saucy dear warm-hearted girl how is it that I cannot impress you with my magnificent poses as I do other people? You see through me, you cunning little blue-eyed rogue, and smile to yourself knowing that I am an impostor and still you love me. Dearest, there is one part of your letter I hardly like to allude to. I have no right whatsoever to do so and I recognise that you are free to act as you wish. I will not ask you to remember our children. But remember that we loved each other truly as boy and girl almost in that heavenly summer five years ago in Dublin. Darling, I am a sad-hearted person in reality and O I believe that if such a thing as you seem to be thinking of took place I could not live. No, dear, I am too jealous, too proud, too sad, too lonely! I would not go on living, I think. Even now I feel my heart so quiet and sorrowful at the thought that I can only stare at the words I am writing. How sad life is, from one disillusion to another! Jim",
