  "text": "Dear Mr Huebsch I arrived here a few days ago from Trieste after a rather adventurous journey and am stopping here for some time. My friend in Venice has just sent me on your letter of the 3 June. I am sorry to hear that you have not brought out an American edition of Dubliners but at the same time I must [thank you] for what you have done for it in a friendly way. Mr Mencken sent me the issue of the Smart Set containing my two stories and it gave me great pleasure to read his lively causerie. As you are kind enough to ask me about other books of mine I published a book of love songs some years ago with Mr Elkin Mathews, publisher, Cork Street, Regent Street, London. I am sorry I have not here some of the press notices. In the hurry of my departure I forgot many things. However, if you care to consider that little book you can write to Mr Mathews on the matter. As regards my novel you are well informed. It is called A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and began serial publication in The Egoist (Feby 1914). It has now come to an end, I believe, and the disposal of the book rights is in the hands of my literary agent, Mr James B. Pinker, Talbot House, Arundel Street, Strand, London. He has (or can procure for you) the complete set of printed slips. I hope you will see your way to take on one or other of these books as Mr Mencken wrote to me about your house in the highest terms. I have finished a play in three acts, Exiles, but would prefer the publication in book to come after its eventual production on the stage. With many thanks for your friendly interest Sincerely yours James Joyce",
