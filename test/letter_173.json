Pappie writes urgently for £1– for Xmas: wish I could send it. My own assets are L 16–! Now what’s to be done? You must try A for the money. Try him for L 60.– (£1 = L 26 (incl. ex of sending)) I will send you L 30 on the 1st January. Try him at once and urgently. Am sure he will do it. Send the money here to the bank addressed to me in a registered letter containing a cheque from A’s bank on Rome or, if not, Austrian paper money. Expect letter Wednesday. If you seal letter, don’t use the School stamp. Don’t send money direct to Dublin. Please let me do that. Answer. Jim",
