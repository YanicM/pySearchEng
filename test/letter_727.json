  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: My eyes have not been and are not well. I hope to keep down whatever is threatening. I am very tired. Dr Borsch says he would prefer to operate in 6 weeks or so if the eye can be kept calm. If! I enclose letter from Dijon which disposes of the trial threat. I have not seen Miss Beach since but suppose things are better. I too had a friendly letter from her inviting me to meet Larbaud and Fargue but I did not go. I shall write to the former as soon as I am over this. The leaflet is all right except that the Quarterly should come I think after Mr Huddleston and is that phrase I asked about in it. I can’t read the print with this light. Please send me some copies. I approve of your sending press copies to Mr Wells, also to Mr Bennett (who is entitled to one). I suggest in each case you put a slip marked ‘Nation’ (date) or ‘Outlook’—with the publisher’s compliments. Mr Hemingway writes for the Toronto Star. Mr Lewis ought to get a press copy (not for review). I promised him one and tried during my illness (when was I last well?) to have one sent to him. He did not answer. I heard he was in Venice. I think you ought to inquire about those Quarterlies. Everything else sent me to Nice was forwarded. Strange to say the writer whom I mentioned in my letter asking for them—Mr Marcel Proust—died this day week. His name has often been coupled with mine. People here seem to have expected his death but when I saw him last May he did not look bad. He looked in fact ten years younger than his age. I don’t think Mr Aldington ought to be asked to write a second article. I met Mr Hueffer. He apologised in a way for his article which, he says, was written at your dictation. I am glad you have taken to writing the favourable criticisms. It seems to me I wrote most of them so far—I mean I see my own phrases rolling back to me. I think the English Review comes out about the 26 or 27 of the month. Will you send me 2 copies please? I am sure you are anxious to be away in Cheshire. King Beaver will never find you there. He will start in the shires of Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, Durham etc. My eye now warns me to stop. I send a correspondence from a Dublin paper between Mr Buck Mulligan and Mr Leslie. The only intelligent person in it is the labourer on Mr Leslie’s estate who is evidently a compatriot of the narrator of the Cyclops. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
