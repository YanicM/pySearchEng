  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have tried to send two bouquets to the two actresses but I know nothing about them neither names nor even the theatre—if it is to be given in a theatre? Of course I cannot travel. Even yet I cannot see a light before my eye and have had continual bouts of neuralgic pain in the wound and oceanfuls of tears. I cannot read or even think and am becoming nicely nervous. Kind people now help me to cross the street and hail taxis for me!! I lie on a couch most of the day, waiting for Ireland’s eye this day to do his duty. And I am most completely depressed. I would like to do some work but my state makes me avoid it. I hope the actresses will get two nice bouquets. But why are you not going to the Euston Hotel? 732 rooms, 2 wings, liveried porters, chatty meteorologist in the lift, whispering lounge, English breakfast, vitellusit, Danish bacon, Irish eggs, American sugar, French milk, Canadian marmalade, Scotch porridge, New Zealand butter, Dutch toast. Mr E.H. Knight, manager. I met him every morning and wished him good kday, Mr Knight. He is a very knice kman. I will just add an epigram I made. To a person asking if I go to church: O, yes, I go to mass every morning at Notre Dame de Siam and to vespers every evening at Saint Louis le Debonair. And this limerick: There’s a coughmixture scopolamine And its equal has never been seen ’Twould make staid Tutankamen Laugh and leap like a salmon And his mummy hop Scotch on the green.",
