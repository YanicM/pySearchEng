  "text": "Dear Budgen: Received first instalment of Gibraltar. What is wrong with the rest? Got a syncope fit in theatre and had to be helped out by agent and Giorgio to a cab and then given ether. Work now only 6 hours per day. I send you the first part of Penelope in its draft form to let you see it and have your opinion. This is only the draft. A great deal will be added and changed in 3 proofs. Let me know how it strikes you and return it by registered post as quickly as possible. Will send you some money Monday or Tuesday for the following if obtainable: Love’s Old Sweet Song. In Old Madrid. Fanny Hill’s Memoirs (unexpurgated). If you find this latter you can put a stop [?] on it. You will receive an invitation to dinner from a friend of mine to whom I have spoken about you, R.M., an American poet. I found him very simple and decent. He admires Ulysses very much so that can set you off…. To understand Penelope well you should have an idea of Ithaca but it is not yet ready.",
