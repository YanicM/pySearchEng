  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I should have thanked you before for your kindness and hospitality towards my daughter. I do so now. I am glad to hear that you have returned to London refreshed after a visit…. It is kind of you to propose to go to Ireland after you have paid a sick call to Miss Marsden at Liverpool but unless you are interested in the beauty of Dublin Bay I think the trip useless. Please do not telephone to my cousin. Her opinion is not of the slightest importance to me…. Your letter expresses great sympathy for my sister. Possibly Lucia, not having been brought up as a slave and having neither Bolshevik nor Hitlerite tendencies, made a very bad impression on you and she certainly does not flatter…. How it is all going to end I don’t know. The news from America is also bad, though not of the same kind. Americans apparently can’t even pay at present (they don’t pay me anyway) so why dishonour oneself by going there. You expressed great admiration some time ago for the brighteyed young Brit (I am imagining him), my English publisher, who aroused nothing but sardonic suspicion in my lousy Celtic soul. Well he started printing Ulysses 5 months ago and does not appear to have made any headway. Doubtless the poor wretch is doing his best…. Today Léon read me over the telephone some article or other which he thinks should be used as propaganda by my publisher, the aforesaid blue-eyed cleanminded son of Albion. Putting my own experience of 30 years together with the fact that the richest and most powerful nation in the world was ignobly ejected from Shaunvekland a few years ago by a half dozen savages armed with crucifixes I remain of the opinion that the one and only argument is the boot. My wife thanks you for having remembered her birthday. This was more than her daughter did. So I wrote her a letter of reproach. You can imagine it was terribly stern. Instead of running around from one scruff to another (of course I don’t mean you) she should be in this house which was set up for her. But you can think in what a state my wife’s nerves are after four years of it. And that is the problem, the whole problem and nothing but the problem…. A few days ago I received a note from Miss Monnier asking me ‘had I any objection’. I told them to go ahead. Honestly however I dislike the putting up for sale of the first MS of the Portrait, about 1000 pages. And what rubbish it is! … My wife talks of going to Ireland to see her mother who is 70 odd. I suppose it is only right. A boy’s best friend is his mother and granny you gave me my mammy and that’s the grandest thing a granny can do. The last time, however, she went there she left that blissful isle lying on the floor of a railway carriage with her two children (and mine) while the natives were firing at one another through the carriage windows…. Paris is frightfully dear and has become, they say, the ugly duckling of the great capitals. Most of the foreign colony has fled. For the life of me I cannot see how I personally can hang on. Nevertheless it seems that I do. I daresay this letter sounds rather distracted but for over a year I have been presiding over mothers’ meetings (the fathers or husbands have never been there even to make a show) and I have reached a stage of exasperated exhaustion. Perhaps I shall survive and perhaps the raving madness I write will survive and perhaps it is very funny. One thing is sure, however. Je suis bien triste.",
