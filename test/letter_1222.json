  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Have any notices of Lucia’s designs appeared in the press? Messrs Feebler and Fumbler didn’t send out any press copies as they sold the whole edition out at once and didn’t want to be bothered with more requests. But I made the Dutch publisher send them out a few weeks ago all the same. It took me 9 months to get back the others. But they cannot be out by Xmas. Your doleful comment on my announcement of the English edition of Ulysses is comprehensible but apart from the printers Messrs Lane now say they have had to consult so many lawyers, solicitors, bailiffs, R.C’s, J.P’s etc they feel very strongly I should not ask for the royalty stipulated in the contract. Pinker feels that he feels the same way as they do. And my suggestion that a verbatim reprint of the two U.S. legal decisions in my favour (i.e. 3 judges for, 1 against) should be printed in the English edition is discountenanced by M.S. & Co who cannot see any point in the suggestion as of course it would not have the tiniest weeniest particle of influence on the superb type of British Solon who never never will be etc. etc. Thanks for the book calling my attention to the excellence of the juice of the grape. The best seller who wrote it never had a more ardent disciple than I. But alas not even scraped carrots can solve the dreadful problem which for years has involved me and now confronts me under a bewildering aspect…. I brought Lucia here to be seen by Prof. Naeggeli the best blood specialist in all Europe, they say. Perhaps he can cure her physically. She is not at all anaemic…. The poor child is just a poor girl who tried to do too much, to understand too much. Her dependence on me is now absolute and all the affection she repressed for years pours itself out on both of us. Minerva direct me….",
