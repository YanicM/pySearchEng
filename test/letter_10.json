  "text": "Dear Lady Gregory Your letter has been forwarded to me but I have yet no definite news to give you except that I am going back to Dublin for the Christmas and leave Paris tomorrow night. Your friend Mr Longworth asked me to review two books. I did so, the reviews appeared a fortnight ago but I have received no money. My prospects for studying medicine here are not inviting. Mr Yeats is to see the editor of ‘The Speaker’ some time after Christmas and he suggested to the editor of the ‘Academy’ to take verses of mine but the editor of the ‘Academy’ wants columns of ‘really good verse’. When I have any definite news be sure I shall tell you. O yes—I am teaching a man here and he gives me 10 fr every fortnight. Paris amuses me very much but I quite understand why there is no poetry in French literature; for to create poetry out of French life is impossible. I have no sympathy with the ‘gallant’ French. I am glad the Germans beat them and hope they will beat them again. But heaven forbid the French should perish and the world lose such cooks and dancing masters. But— Es war ein Konig in Thule Gar treu bis an das Grab James A Joyce",
