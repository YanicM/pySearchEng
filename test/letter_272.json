  "text": "Dear Stannie My plans are to leave Ireland with Eileen on Saturday night week (1. Jan 1910). The first thing you must send at once is the Indicatore Generale delle Ferrovie dell’Alta Italia for Dec 1909 and Jan 1910, price 25c. ‘Volta’ is open and doing fairly well. On the 29th I appear before Recorder in order to get licence for music. If that is granted I leave as above. Try to get in some big payment by 29, 30 or 31 inst and wire all you can. Devin was to have paid me today and did not do so. If notice appears in P. d. S. show it also to my creditors. It will have a good effect especially on Scholz. This is such a dreadful house that it is a God’s act to rescue Eileen from it. Let us try to manage it. I dread the sea this weather. I am awfully tired after all the worry I have had. Don’t let the posters get torn. Will send more tomorrow. Tomorrow is Xmas Eve but I am in a state of absolute apathy about it. Hope you enjoyed yourselves. Tell my pupils I am due there in a few days. Hope you went on regularly with Bartoli. Have sent cards to all my pupils. Hope you were not offended by my card. I sent it for a joke. Nora’s mother sent me a turkey as a Xmas box but I wish I was in Via Scussa. It is four a.m. (4 a.m.) now. Have been up making a/cs with Soci. M and R leave for Bucarest on Xmas Day. Got V’s letter, points will be discussed more fully in Trieste. A third composer, Herbert Hughes, wants to set my verses or has set some of them. Could not possibly send money for Xmas. Try to wire a good lift. Chance of a lifetime ‘My chaunce and wöch.’ Enjoy yourselves well. Drink my health (?) in good strong puncetti. Tell Giorgino I am per la strada. Hope all will turn out well. Try to get some ‘cork-lino’ for kitchen. Explain to my pupils that I have no time to write them. Rheumatism seems to be better but am awfully played out. Wire all you can. Book cost me occhio della testa. No matter if some temporary inconvenience is caused as I presume Alessandro Volta will come to the rescue one day. Am serious about your having J. Why not? All the money I have I spend. ‘We may be happy yet’. Wire what you can e poi si suona il campanello di partenza. Abfahrt! O, that poor well-meaning Oesterreische [sic] railway-man! I am sure he has a rather large family. Get in plenty of coal and wood. Will not be seeing anyone for a week after arrival. After all, I managed to do it and I suppose the bori will come in. Help your poor sister! Jim",
