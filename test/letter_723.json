  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: A few lines for today to let you know that yesterday my eye took a sudden turn for the better and I hope to have still more good news tomorrow in spite of the miserable weather. I hope you are not having any trouble with the second edition as your letter suggests. I believed that the general election would have been a good cover for the affair. I send you my list of corrections pages 1 to 290 which you can perhaps check and forward. At the end of the cahier are the names of group B to whom I should like copies of the new leaflet A (on different coloured paper) to be forwarded. I hope you can read my handwriting as I could only scribble. Has Mr Aldington written an article since he got his press copy? If not could you write to him in view of the third edition? Also Mr Linati whom you could ask if Mr Emilio Cecchi wrote about it in La Ronda. I sent you two French notices. I think they should be used, even a few words, also La Revue de Bourgogne and if possible La Semaine Littéraire, all together about the middle of the leaflet, the more French notices the better. Mr Leslie. is also Domini Canis so Mr Colum says. I leave you to make your choice from his article which is having the effect I foresaw. It is the best thing he could have done for the book to give it prestige in England. The fact that it is adverse, in my opinion will not count. In America it will have no effect as the hierarchy of English reviews is not understood there but I think Mr Quinn and Mr Thayer (group B) should have copies along with the Manchester Guardian (the entire paper with passage marked in red pencil—to be bought in London or suburbs). I sent back her copy to Miss Beach so can you send me one for myself and also the July number which has an article on Monsieur Proust. Its effect on French critics will be I fancy to get their backs up which is just what I want. In conclusion I think Mr Leslie likes Ulysses strange as it may seem but I shall write to you about that later on.",
