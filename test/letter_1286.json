  "text": "Dear Sir: My uncle-in-law Mr Michael Healy has asked me to send you a prospectus concerning the facsimile MS edition of my booklet Pomes Penyeach (so brought out in Paris in 1932) which I had much pleasure in offering to your library and you the graciousness to accept. Two other European libraries possess copies, the Biblioth√®que Nationale here and the British Museum in London. But I wished to offer a copy to your library not only because the designer of the lettrines is a granddaughter of your city and the writer of the verses bears one of its tribal names but also as a small acknowledgement of a great debt of gratitude to Mr Healy himself for his kindness and courtesy during so many years. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
