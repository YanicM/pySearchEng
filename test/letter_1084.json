  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I saw Miss Beach…. She had had confirmation that Roth had brought out and sold off to someone else an edition of 10,000 and suggested to me that Hemingway’s lawyer would take up the case over there. I declined to have anything more to do with lawyers. I said Pinker’s opinion was that the only way to stop Roth was to get a U.S. publisher to take the book. She asked did I want that. I said if Roth went on for 3 years more the American market, already crippled, would be killed outright. She said a U.S. edition meant shutting her shop and rearing chickens but that she would do it if it was my wish…. [Mrs Colum’s] idea is that the U.S. publication ought to be made at once as it would mean the Nobel Prize for me and an English publication the year after. The sheepish premier did not bleat yesterday and the numbskull who smokes the pipe neither. Why doesn’t W.L. do something since the pound’s gone ezra. Strange to say I am trying to write. I hope someone takes your flat and that we take someone’s. Kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
