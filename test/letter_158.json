  "text": "Dear Stannie, Symons wrote to me: I am glad to hear from you again. When I named you to Grant Richards it was before his failure: I should hardly have done it since. Still, as he has apparently begun to print yr. book I would be inclined to give in to him as far as you can without vitally damaging your work. If he signed an agreement to publish the 12 stories why not hold him to that? and you could hold over the other two stories for another book later. The great thing is to get published so that people may have a chance of reading you. I will write a line to G.R. advising him not to lose yr. book. I hope you will arrange it between you. Now as to yr. poems, I feel almost sure that I can get Elkin Mathews to print them in his shilling Garland series. You would get little money from him but I think it would be worth your while to take what he offered—probably a small royalty after expenses are covered. He did for me a little set of translations from Baudelaire’s ‘Petits Poèmes en Prose’. The cost was £14–14–0 and it is now nearly covered when my royalty will begin. Tell me if I may write and advise him to take the book. If it comes out I will give it the best review I can in the ‘Saturday’ or ‘Athenaeum’ and I will get one or two other people to give it proper notices. I hope you are getting on well in Rome. Let me have a line promptly about the poems. I answered, accepting his offer about the verses and am waiting a few days more to see if G.R. will write. Tell me what arrangement you propose for the verses. I will follow it perfunctorily as I take very little interest in the publication of the verses. I see no reason however why I should refuse to publish them—do you? And I would be glad if they antedated Dubliners. I suppose they have some merit! and perhaps, if they sold, I might make ten or twenty pounds out of them next year. Is my attitude on the point the sign of a blunted or of a more developed mind? Tell me ought I retain the name. I don’t like it much. By the way can you account for the friendly tone of S’s letter? The last dealing I had with him was when I served a copy of The Holy Office upon him. I connect it in some way with G’s letters. I suppose I will soon have a letter from some of the others. Symons, however, has a smart English business-like way of doing things which is highly satisfactory. Yesterday being the anniversary of the day of my espousal and of the day of the gladness of my heart, we went out into the country and ate and drank the greater portion of several larders. Here is the full and exact list of what we ate yesterday.",
