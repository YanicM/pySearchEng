  "text": "Dear Pound: As you live là-bas can you tell me what I ought to do. Italian papers, Il Mattino (Naples), La Fiera Letteraria etc have several times published translations of things of mine. They never consult me, inform me or pay me. I see that Il Convegno last October or so published Rossi’s translation of Episode 1 of Ulysses. Didn’t I write you something about that when you were here? Of course, they pay me nothing. What do you say? Is it all right? Sincerely yours James Joyce",
