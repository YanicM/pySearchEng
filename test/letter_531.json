  "text": "Dear Mr Quinn: Many thanks for your letter. As you are going to enjoy a holiday I shall not inflict on you a long reply. Mr Bennett is at present in Panama, and if you are able, as you suggest, to bring home to him in a salutary way the enormity of his conduct (Mr Augustine Birrell in writing described it as ‘outrageous’) you will, in my opinion, serve the interests of all men of letters and oblige me in particular. Mr Colum on hearing of the affair at once raised a subscription of 10,000 francs, of which 5,000 francs have been paid up; and with this it will be possible to beat down the boorish and insolent opposition which has thwarted the scheme. I may say that my health and work have suffered greatly owing to the affair. I hope you will succeed in inducing some company to put on Exiles in New York. It has been refused by the Stage Society, Pioneer Players and Abbey Theatre and, so far as I can see, there is no prospect of its production in the United Kingdom. It will be produced in Munich next week for the first time and, if successful, probably also in Stuttgart and Vienna. I have hopes that it will go on the Italian stage also when translated. Mr Carlo Linati (the translator of The Playboy of the Western World) has written to me about it. Miss Hermine Koerner (late of Mr Reinhardt’s company) plays the chief part in Munich. Ulysses will not be finished probably till the end of next year—if even then. A chapter takes me about four or five months to write. I wish you a pleasant holiday in that interesting part of the world you are bound for. I am badly in need of rest and quiet, too. With kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Miss Weaver has just written of a ‘magnificent defence’ of Ulysses written by you of which Mr Pound has told her. She wishes to reprint it m The Egoist. I thank you in advance. It is extraordinary that American law allows an employee to penalize a citizen for not having committed an offence. I allude to the penalizing of Miss Anderson on account of suppressed passages.
