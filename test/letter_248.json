  "text": "Dear Stannie I received tonight your wire: Wire i?4 writ landlord. I left Trieste a month ago. Since then I wrote you several times and had no answer. This is your first communication to me except a few lines scribbled on the back of Machnich’s scrawl. When I left Trieste I handed over to you the following pupils: Popper, Bolaffio, Veneziani (Mrs), Castelbolognese, Sordina to say nothing of Höberth, Bartoli and Latzer. These I presume paid you or some of them in addition to your own pupils. Was nothing out of the money paid to landlord? From your wire I gather that he is suing for the months of October and November—two months, as you say to wire £4t. I am going now to the G.P.O. to wire you: Spedisco posta consulti avvocato. I enclose you a receipt for 82 crowns, owed me for postal, telegraphic and copying expenses by my principals. Present it to Vidacovich whom I authorise to pay you. Tomorrow morning as soon as Cook’s is open I shall go and buy a 20 crown note and send it so that you will have it a few hours after this. That will be 52 crowns. Raise 4.66 and pay at once one month and promise double rent on 1st December. I cannot send more. Pappie is in Jervis Street Hospital (eyes) and I am supporting this house. The provisional contract will be presented to me at any moment to be stamped (£1–10–0) and I must keep some money myself. A notice to quit has been served on this house for the 1st of December so that, thank God, we will all be on the pavement together for Xmas. Charlie writes me that he is destitute, has sold everything for food, goes out at six in the morning to look for work etc and his wife is ailing. I cannot approach Kettle but I have got a most urgent letter for him to an influential man in Boston: and send it express tomorrow. What will happen here I don’t know as Pappie is on the broad of his back in hospital. I paid over £50 earnest money on Mary Street. Plans go before Corporation tomorrow and will be passed I am assured. The licence then follows at once. A letter from Vidacovich tells me that Machnich is leaving for Bucarest (dated last Friday). A telegram from the same quarter says he leaves for Dublin today (Wednesday). Up to now (midnight) his departure has not been telegraphed to me. If he does not come or wire I am in a most difficult position. My solicitor writes tomorrow to Vidacovich to have my partners give me power of attorney to sign lease, insurance policy and licence. I write either to Machnich or Vidacovich long letters nearly every night, reporting all I have done but receive contradictory and tardy replies. Machnich was due here on the 5th by contract. Has he left Trieste for Bucarest or Dublin or does he intend to leave? My letters to him and to you are not the only ones that go unanswered. I wrote to Steiner (on whom I asked you to call) enclosing a long report on Irish tweeds, Donegals and suitings and accompanying it with a parcel of nearly 100 samples. No acknowledgement and no answer. I wrote to Count Sordina a long letter of ten or twelve pages like this containing every scrap of information, names and addresses, I could find relating to coursing. No acknowledgement and no answer from him either. To sum up my position is this. I have sent stuff and gloves to Trieste, bought an overcoat and boots for Eileen and am supporting this house and spent £1–10–0 for telegrams and registered letters. The stamp duty on the contract now lying in Charlie Murray the solicitor’s office is £1–10–0. If that document is not stamped within 7 days its validity can be impugned. It was signed two days ago and I may be called on at any moment for the stamping. Not to be able to stamp it would again excite the suspicions of the landlord who gave both Murray and myself no end of trouble by his constant changes of front and evasions. In addition I must keep to carry on this house till the 1st of December. More dieta falls due to me on this day week (25th inst) but Machnich may again delay and leave me waiting. I don’t know how much I must also reserve as fee for applying for licence, to say nothing of other possible expenses. Now about the landlord again. I don’t know the terms of our agreement or in what time according to Austrian law he can put us out. I send you the equivalent for 32 crowns and by the next post express 20 crowns. Pay one month at once as I said and if Machnich comes I will send more on the 25th. You need have no hesitation in presenting receipt for payment. In my letter to V last night I tendered a detailed note of my outlay independent of the dieta summing to £1–7–0 = 32 crowns. 56 Cr. 66 should keep the landlord quiet for a week at least so that I fancy we are more in danger of the street here than you there if Pappie continues helpless. I shall be in a state of continual agitation until I hear from you how the affair is shaping. In the meantime have recourse to your solicitor Paulini who knows you and can persuade Scholz that you are una persona per bene. Send me a wire at once (the one word ‘Rounded’) and I shall know you have rounded this corner. Prevent an eviction at all costs. Should the 32 crowns have been already sent me by V I shall wire it back to you five minutes after I receive it. In somma on Saturday or Sunday you will be in a position to pay 56.66 and perhaps on that day week another 56.66. Surely to Christ you cannot be evicted in that case. Wire at once. I post this now 2 a.m. It goes off at 5 a.m. At 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. I send the 20 crowns by express post, that is 5 hours after. Both will reach you by Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning. If V has sent me money I shall have it also Saturday or Sunday and shall rewire it. I send this also express. Jim Don’t leave me without a wire from you. Sell every stick in the house if necessary, to prevent Nora and Georgie and Lucia from being put out in this weather. Jesus Christ, what a fearful muddle! Wire",
