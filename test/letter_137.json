  "text": "Dear Stannie, The bank interview went off all right yesterday. My hours are 8Â½ to 12 and 2 to damn long. Have not much to do yet. I was paid 65 lire for the journey and got an advance of 100 lire, so that for the present I seem safe. I lost my way twice here. The streets are very confusing. Many things are cheaper than in Trieste but I expect to lose money for the first week or two. Last night we heard a band in the Piazza Colonna play a selection from Siegfried. Very fine. Romans are excruciatingly well-mannered. Send on the news. Jim",
