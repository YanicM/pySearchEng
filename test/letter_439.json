  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Thanks for your letter and remittance (58 frs. 10 c). Dubliners: Can you find out if Mr Richards has my list of corrections of printer’s errors? Does he intend to bring out a second edition? I see that on 31 December last he had only 88 copies left. If so proofs are to be sent me with my list of corrections. If not the list of corrections ought to be sent to my New York publisher (a copy of it) and as soon as possible. Exiles: Will you please get from Mr Yeats or Mr Pound the typescript of this and offer it to Mr Richards? He, or his reader, could read it in an hour and a half so that I think a fortnight is enough time for its consideration. In the contract I should like the date of publication to be fixed—not later than 15 December next—and I should also like to be allowed 10 presentation copies not 6 and as many other copies as I need at trade rates. As regards its production if Mr Yeats will not put it on it could perhaps be offered to some repertory theatre, the Pioneer Players or to Mrs Grein’s theatre. Proofs: I shall be very much obliged if you will see that in future first and revise proofs are sent to me. The novel does not seem to have been read. I am sending in a few days a list of printer’s errors. It will be enough to forward them to New York with a polite covering letter. I thank you very much for your kind enquiries about my health. I am feeling much better and can now write again. I have written to Mr Wells to thank him for his friendly and interesting notice and hope that the letter reached him. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
