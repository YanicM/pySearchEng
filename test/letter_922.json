  "text": "Dear Mr Aldington: During my absence from Paris your letter was mislaid. I am writing to thank you for your suggestion but suit was entered against Roth on 23 March and I shall wait the result. I understand his magazines have been stopped. I have to thank you also for your signature to the letter of protest. I think it will have some effect. Have you still the dossier of the English Players which I sent you from Locarno? If so I shall be very glad if you will send it to Miss Sylvia Beach, 12 rue de lâ€™Odeon, Paris. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
