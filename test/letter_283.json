  "text": "Dear Mr Palmer: Your letter has just been sent on here from Dublin. I do not know the North of Ireland except a little of Belfast. If you intended to go west or south I could guide you better. However, I have inquired from an Irish friend of mine here, a Mr Price, who comes from the Ards of Down. He says if you wish to go to Donegal your best centres would be Londonderry, Letterkenny or Ballyshannon. Your best plan would be to insert at once an advertisement in The Derry Sentinel, published in Derry saying that you want to board at the figure you state. You should get plenty of answers. If you like I will write to a friend of mine in Belfast, a Mr Reynolds who is musical critic of the Belfast Evening Telegraph and has set two or three of the songs from C.M. Perhaps he might know of a vacancy such as you desire in Ulster. I fancy by your name that you are a protestant. Could you not write directly to the headquarters of the Irish Church in Dublin offering your services and stating your qualifications which are surely too good! This would be the shortest way. Mr Elkin Mathews has sent me a published setting of O, it was out by Donnycarney composed by a Mr Adolph Mann who has written me a very kind and flattering letter and seems to be at work on two other songs in the book. The song I mention has now been set by three composers but Mr Mann has secured the rights of it so that I am afraid that even if you should find a publisher, you cannot publish yours. I am sorry for this but I thought you had protected your rights on those settings. There is another composer, a fourth, who I think will do some of them also. I am in a rather strange position in the matter so that I think it is better to leave the matter in Mr Elkin Mathews’ hands. My reason, however, for writing you is to let you know how the case is lest you should perhaps blame me afterwards. I think your music is very elegant and would like it to be sung. Many thanks for your kind enquiries about my writing. I have not written any more verse but am busy correcting the proofs of my new book Dubliners (a volume of stories) which Messrs Maunsel and Co, Dublin, are to bring out next month. I hope it may interest you though I don’t think you will recognise me in it at a first glance as it is somewhat bitter and sordid. Please let me know how you fare about the Donegal project.",
