  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for the copy of Dublin Review. I read the article with special interest. It is curious that it was not sent on to me by the presscutting agency when it appeared. In fact I have not received anything from them for quite a long time so that perhaps I am already forgotten. I should like to know what is the decision of the printer you alluded to as Mr Rodker, to whom I spoke here, suggested another plan. He would like to read the episodes Nausikaa and Oxen of the Sun in order to estimate their length. Could you perhaps let him have them for a few days? As regards Mr Huebsch I understand that he is coming to London. His behaviour towards me lately has not been satisfactory and his attitude with regard to the book seems to me dubious. I am altogether too tired to enter into any controversy with him or anyone else about it. The final adventure Circe is giving me in all ways a great deal of worry. I have written the greater part of it four or five times. I am glad Ulysses had only twelve adventures. Circe [sic] herself had less trouble weaving her web than I have with her episode. I have been asked by a Mr Vanderpyl to have a copy of my novel sent to Mr Pierre Mille, 12 Quai de Bourbon, Paris IVe, a writer and literary critic of Le Temps. I daresay you have been troubled enough with requests of this kind already. Two chapters are translated and there is talk of its appearing in the Mercure de France. There is also talk of Exiles being produced in French and Italian. I have not yet received the third act of the Italian version. I understand that the Spanish and Swedish translations are coming out soon. I hope that I shall soon have definite news to send you as I dislike talk that leads nowhere. Mr Pound introduced me to a number of people here on whom I created anything but a good impression. He did his best to work up a reputation for my books here but whether he will be as moderately successful as he was in London remains to be seen. Do you mean that the Oxen of the Sun episode resembles Hades because the nine circles of development (enclosed between the headpiece and tailpiece of opposite chaos) seem to you to be peopled by extinct beings? With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
