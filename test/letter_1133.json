  "text": "Dear McAlmon: I have 7 names good each for a subscription of £10, payable about October next, (i.e. myself, you, T.S.E., H.W. etc) and have given in 7 others of whom I am morally sure. (Lady Cunard, her daughter, WL, Antheil and Mrs Herbert Gorman). I am sure I can find easily another 6. That will make £200 and we can probably run it up to £300 but if when called on you happen to be short I can easily cover the two names and we can settle it some time or other. As a matter of fact, I am your debtor. As regards Gorman (or rather Mrs Gorman whose name I give) I think you must be misinformed. Colm who knows them well for years told me they had fairly ample means. I always found her very freehanded but there is of course no earthly reason why she is obliged to subscribe. I wish you could help him with his book. People are unnecessarily hostile to him. I hope he is well and yourself the same sincerely yours J.J.",
