  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: Is it quite certain that you will be in Paris on Thursday morning next and will you be passing the night of the same day, Candlemas, here? Because, if so, and if Lady Carlow is with you my daughter-in-law who is giving a dinner party in my honour and to celebrate the publication of my book asks me to say that you will be very welcome both. It is at my son’s place this year 17 Villa Scheffer, Paris XVIe. There is another point. My book is to be sent over on Wednesday by air express but unfortunately the delivery of these parcels is never certain because they pass through the Douane to collect a minimal duty and, of course, the douanier can have no idea that I shall be waiting for the wretched parcel. It might arrive at the last moment after a day of exhaustive waiting and even that would be too late to allow of my showing it to my daughter (who lives outside Paris) in the early afternoon. Or it might just arrive the morning after the 2nd in which case I should feel inclined to throw it out of the window. In sum, I should like to be sure of having it on that morning. It was only after you had rung off that I thought of this. Of course, I don’t want to interfere in any way with your plans but as you told them to me they seemed to fit in with my idea. If you are not already in the country or at air work somewhere perhaps you could ring up Faber and Faber. The person who is [in] charge of the book there is Mr de la Mare. The book is to be sent from the Glasgow printers or binders on Monday. Anyhow a telegram from you one way or another would relieve my mind. I am still very exhausted but I shall try to be better by Thursday though I am afraid the traditional pas seul with high kicking effects associated with that birthday feast will be beyond my powers this year of grace. Incidentally you will discover the title of the book which my wife has kept secret for seventeen years, being the only one who knew it. I think I can see some lofty thinkers and noble livers turning away from it with a look of pained displeasure Sincerely yours James Joyce",
