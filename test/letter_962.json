  "text": "Dear Larbaud: I was sorry to have bad news of you but am glad to hear you are now better. We are snatching a few days’ holiday in Dieppe and here but as soon as I return to Paris I shall put matters right with Miss Monnier—or I hope so. Gilbert wrote to me before I left Paris but I avoided the issue—though I personally found him quite obliging and well-intentioned—and shall abide by our ‘Trianon treaty’ as the best way to avoid friction. Svevo was entertained by the Paris Pen Club last week (Gesumaria, che vino e che cena!) and our names were mentioned often by Romains who presided as his ‘godfathers’. If we had a literary ‘grandson’ what age would he be? Sincerely yours James Joyce",
