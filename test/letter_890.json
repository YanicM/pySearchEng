  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: These rapid lines are to wish you many happy returns of your birthday. I hope they reach you in time as I have found the post here rather slow—2 days from Paris, a 5 hours run. I am sorry to hear your sister had such a time in the storm—a dreadful experience for an immobilised person! The only good thing is that sometimes a shock like that does good and in any case a visitation of that kind rarely recurs … I am of a sudden overladen with work. Last week the entire typescript of Ulysses in German arrived and on top of it the German translator to revise it with me. We work together all day practically, word for word. They want to bring it out in October!!! I am sorry to hear of Miss Marsden’s trouble and of course do not bother about the disk in such circumstances. All the same I was glad to have your notes on my voice and would like more about my non-rhetorical accents when you feel so inclined. I hope the German publisher won’t rush the translation—and me. With renewed good wishes and kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
