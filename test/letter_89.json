  "text": "Put copies of ‘Holy Office’ into different envelopes and deliver with the flaps closed, and addressed upon all interested. Do not omit Skeffington and Cousins. You will find addresses in directory. Byrne, Ellwood and Cosgrave also. The ‘Leprechaun’ disturbed my peace. I am studying Danish again with constancy. Do you know that Ibsen’s married life ended by his leaving his wife? He is a curious lyrical poet. I think Wordsworth of all English men of letters best deserves your word ‘genius’. Read his poem to his lost son in ‘Excursion’ I think which begins ‘Where art thou my beloved son.’ I am now definitely studying for the theatre. Sinico, a maestro here, tells me that after two years I can do so. My voice is extremely high: he says it has a very beautiful timbre. I shall report on success of my verses with Lane. I changed the last couplet of ‘Though I thy Mithridates were’ and I have omitted the words ‘To Nora’ from the first poem. Write long letters. Was going to Venice this morning but it began to rain.
