  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have received two very long letters from Mr Quinn of New York concerning Ulysses and The Little Review but before I reply I should like to know whether you have had any communication from anybody in New York on the subject. It seems that the case is on its way now to a third hearing and I knew nothing about it till Mr Pound sent me on Mr Quinn’s letters…. Circe has been very much delayed by a number of causes—my journey here, all the unsatisfactory interviews I have had here with people who seemingly do not know their own intentions and also the fact that the case of books and documents which I sent on to Paris from Trieste on 28 June to enable me to write the two episodes Circe and Eumeus here went astray. After a great deal of writing, wiring and interviewing it was at last discovered at a station on the Franco-German frontier. It arrived a few days ago after its odyssey and I am now writing out the final (the sixth or seventh) draft of the episode which is about twice as long as the longest episode hitherto, The Cyclops. I have returned to this address my tenancy of the flat (which was very damp) in Passy having expired. I spent nearly a month looking for a flat here, several hours a day, and could find nothing. I then decided that if the book is to be finished I must waste no more time looking for what does not exist. I wish I had some definite news to give you about the French translation of my novel. Someone is supposed to be translating it and several enthusiastic people are supposed to be going to publish it. Exiles has been translated into French, this I can vouch for because I had a copy of the translation in my hands. It is a stage version, I believe, and the play has been accepted by Mr Lugné Poë of the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre for production this season. I have now the third act of the Italian version and shall send it on in a day or two. I have telegraphed to Mr Pound as by another letter of Mr Quinn’s it appears that he (Mr Pound) cabled to Mr Quinn in consequence of some letter which he had received from New York. I have also written to Mr Rodker asking whether any of the Oxen of the Sun episode had appeared. With kind regards and apologies for this tiresome and complicated letter.",
