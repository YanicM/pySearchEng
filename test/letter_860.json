  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Just a line to say we got back last night to this semi-arctic clime. On arriving I find that the Calendar printers flatly refuse to compose Madame Anna Livia. Miss Beach thinks I ought to see Mr Gorman before he returns to U.S.A. so I am proposing to meet him halfway at Boulogneâ€”where the Patricks come from. A Milan publisher wants to present U. to the Italian public and three Greeks called on Miss Beach with a mysterious book for me which they are sending. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
