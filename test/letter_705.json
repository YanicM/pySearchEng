  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I hope this will reach you in time. I expected that at least The Dial would have arrived today with Mr Eliot’s article but not even that has come. It must be very disappointing to you that no review of the book has appeared in the English press. I do not count the Observer which was merely preparing the way nor the Sporting Times whose reputation, by the way, is worse than my own. In fact there is a rumour here that certain critics who had asked for press copies and obtained them had decided to boycott the book. I am inclined to believe it. I read the press cuttings you sent me. There is something rather appropriate in some people’s names. It will surprise me very much if that society you mention ever produces Exiles. At regular intervals somebody appears suddenly from somewhere professing great enthusiasm for the play and affirming that he is going to put it on. Nothing more is ever heard of him. The question of a stage fee is quite secondary—at least with such a company as this appears to be. I have just had a visit from the proofreader of ‘La Sirène’, 29 Boulevard Malesherbes (the publisher who has the French version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man)…. He says the whole work must be revised by a competent translator of their own choosing and he wants the original text. This should be sent to Mr Paul Lafitte at the above address. Goodness knows what they will make of it between them. Their minds seem to wander about like the rocks in my episode. One person who is supposed to be reviewing the book (and has read it all) and wants to be strictly accurate, asks me whether the Christian name of Mrs Bloom is Milly or Molly. Another American ‘critic’ who wanted to interview me (I declined) told me he had read the book with great interest but that he could not understand why Bloom came into it. I explained to him why and he [was] surprised and disappointed for he thought Stephen was Ulysses. He had heard some talk of Penelope and asked me who she was. This also I told him but did not convince him entirely because he said rather doubtfully ‘But is Penelope a really Irish name?’ Mr Larbaud’s article has caused a great deal of stir here and there will be another by Mr Pound in the Mercure on the 15 instant. Mr Pound has been engaged in a long wordy war with Mr Shaw over Ulysses. They exchanged about a dozen letters in all. Mr Shaw has now closed the correspondence by writing ‘I take care of the pence because the pounds won’t take care of themselves’. Possibly he has been reading the books distributed by Bloom’s bodyguard, R 459 Pennywise’s Way to Wealth.",
