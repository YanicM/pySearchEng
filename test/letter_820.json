  "text": "Dear McAlmon: Glad to hear from you. By what date (latest) do you want my copy and on what date (earliest) will the book be out because I promised to give him a piece for the August number of his review and what I give you will depend on your date, that is, as being a piece earlier or later than his. I hope you will get something from him, Lewis and Poundâ€”in spite of the faux pas. But do you think Miss Weaver ought to contribute to a publication dedicated to herself? There is unpleasant news for me. I have cataract and am to be operated next Saturday. This came on me as a surprise. Borsch did not tell me and I could not understand how my sight went on failing. He says I will get my sight back. These continued operations are dreadful.",
