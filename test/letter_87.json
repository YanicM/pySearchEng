Tell Norman I am publishing ‘Eveline’ and ‘The Sisters’ and ask him to write for you permission for me to reprint them. I have written to John Lane: he has answered asking me to send on my verses for consideration. Keep these sheets of The Holy Office till you get directions from me in a day or two. I am expecting a letter from you. I send my verses to Lane on Wednesday. Jim",
