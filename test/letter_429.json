  "text": "Dear Pound: Drama has refused to publish my play. Has Mr Knoblock read it. You said also that it could be submitted to Seven Arts. Miss Weaver wishes to publish an article on me with a woodcut as an introduction of the novel: and mentions your name. I imagine the readers of that paper must be rather tired of my novel and I am sure you are too. If you do the article please quote my limerick also! I am better and carrying out a rest cure and have had no more unpleasant attacks. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
