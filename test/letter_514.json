  "text": "Dear Miss Guillermet: You will think me very remiss for not having written ere now. I have been ill again with my eyes for the sixth time! If I am a sun, as you say, it is a sun which is often under an eclipse. I should be glad to receive the book you speak of. I think I ought to go away for a holiday but man proposes and God disposes. I am grateful for your interest in my work—though you seem to dislike it sufficiently. I do not like it myself mais que voulez-vous? I thank you for your kind suggestions. Perhaps one day I shall go to Geneva. I never go anywhere it seems unless somebody fetches me to a train and locks me into a coupé with a ticket. I regret that through no fault of yours I was unable to include your name among those of the critics of Exiles. I am not sure however that the play interested you. A translation (German) will be published in Zurich next week by Rascher and Co of here and possibly the play will be produced somewhere some day (or night). I am thinking more about the book I am writing, Ulysses, which I daresay you would find as remote from yourself as the sun—or some other solar system. The English printers refuse to print it and they surely know what is right and what is wrong.",
