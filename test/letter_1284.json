  "text": "My dear Mr Healy: Just a few lines for today. Our friend returned from Dublin, Her account was far worse than yours for she succeeded in getting at the facts which you rightly suspected were being concealed from you as they have been from me for four months. Yesterday I had an air-message from M. Bailly saying Lucia had called on him and asked him to have her placed in a nursing home. I had been arranging for her removal to England but upon this I telephoned Curran and this morning had a wire to say that she was now temporarily in a comfortable nursing-home. Apparently she is physically stronger and less unhappy. But I must think out some new plan for her. I hope Kathleenâ€™s operation will soon be over and successfully. With very kind greetings sincerely yours James Joyce",
