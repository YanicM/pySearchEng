  "text": "Dear Eliot: We are well installed here for a good month, I hope, and like it very much. I hope you got A.L.P. from Paris. Gilbert is staying here for a week or so and has sent you on the typescriptâ€”less two or three chapters which he is still at work on. He says that Cape wanted to publish the book but his reader dissuaded him, saying there was no interest for Ulysses in England. I suppose he knows the situation but possibly such an interest can be created. I hope Mrs Eliot is going on well and that we may have an occasion to meet when we go back to London Sincerely yours James Joyce",
