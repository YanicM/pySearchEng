  "text": "Dear Stannie I saw Curran last night and he said that Lidwell’s letter was thoroughly bad for my case. I went to see Lidwell last night at the Ormond Hotel. I found him in company of several others telling stories. Here are some of the stories: A priest in the country had two servant girls and it happened that the closet pipe was choked and the first servant told the second to tell the priest. The second one was ashamed to do so and the first one said: —Arrah, tell him! Does he think we’re cuckoos?— Pappie then told this story: —A bishop visited a P.P. and stayed too late to go home. The P.P. asked him to stay and said there were only two beds in the house, his own and that of his housekeeper. The bishop said he would sleep in the P.P’s bed for one night. They went to bed. In the morning the P.P. half awoke and hit the bishop a smack on the backside saying: —Get up, Mary Ann, I’ll be late for mass— And, by God, the very next day His Grace was made an archbishop.— I could not speak to Lidwell. Today I saw him and spoke to him for an hour. He repeated that it was disgusting and told [me] I could write another story about Ringsend which has many historical associations. In the end he wrote, after many protests, the enclosed letter. I took it to Roberts. He said it was no use since it was not written to him. I asked Lidwell would he write it to Roberts. He refused, saying that I not Roberts was his client. I told this then to Roberts. He said that Lidwell should write him a letter on the whole case stating how I stood and what I would do. I said L’s letter showed that there was no danger from the Crown. Roberts said he could not endanger the firm. I asked him what was the cost of the first edition. He said he did not know. I said if it was not over £60 that I would sign an agreement to indemnify the firm for that amount if the book was confiscated. He said that that was no good and asked me if I could get two securities for £1000 each (in all £2000) to indemnify the firm. I said that no person would do that and that in any case it could never be proved whether the firm’s losses were caused by me or not. He said in that case the discussion was ended and that he would act on his legal advice and not publish. I then wrote him the enclosed letter. He said he would send it tonight to his solicitor in London and let me know. I saw Rochford and spoke to him about Charlie. He said the salary would be £10 a year but that it would be an opening. I arranged for him to hear Charlie’s voice on Sunday. I have had no word from you or remittance. Eva and Florrie would have nothing to eat but for my accidental presence here. Whatever happens be careful to follow my instructions about the table and desk. If Mrs Borsieri will not take both let her take the table (I am speaking of course of the little table in my bedroom not of the new walnut one): and let you take the desk. Am awaiting your remittance and letter to go back. All this interviewing means constant drinks at my expense and my money is constantly dwindling. Nora is waiting to come here and she wants to spend a few days in my company here for reasons you can imagine. They will be lenten days, however. I saw Pappie. He says Roberts will raise a new objection when his solicitor replies and that he is a swindler. He told Charlie privately that my stories are a blackguard production. He told me that all the girls in Dublin were prostitutes. Ahimè! Jim",
