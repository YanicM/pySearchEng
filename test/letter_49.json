  "text": "My dear, dear Nora I suppose you have been very much upset since last night. I will not speak of myself for I feel as if I had acted very cruelly. In a way I have no right to expect that you should regard me as anything more than the rest of men—in fact in view of my own life I have no right at all to expect it. But yet I seemed to have expected it if only because I myself had never regarded anyone as I regarded you. There is something also a little devilish in me that makes me delight in breaking down people’s ideas of me and proving to them that I am really selfish, proud, cunning and regardless of others. I am sorry that my attempt last night to act according to what I believed to be right should have given you so much pain but I do not see how I could have acted otherwise. I wrote you a long letter explaining as well as I could how I felt that night and it seemed to me that you were putting aside what I said and treating me as if I were simply a casual comrade in lust. You will perhaps object to the brutality of my words but, believe me, to treat me as that is, so far as my attitude towards you is concerned, to dishonour me. Surely to God you are a woman and can understand what I say! I know that you have acted very nobly and very generously to me but try and answer my frankness with like frankness. Above all do not go about brooding as it will make you ill and you know that you are in delicate health. Perhaps you will be able to send me even a line tonight to say that you can forgive me for all the pain I have caused you. Jim",
