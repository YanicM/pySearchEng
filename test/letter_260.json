  "text": "Delay in opening as Recorder is not sitting and we must have his licence. Are trying to get a provisional one. Have found a singer for my songs, W. Sheehan who is J.C. Doyleâ€™s rival. He wants to see them. Send the eight carefully registered. Why has Schmitz not replied to my letter? Contrattempo also owing to non-arrival of machine. All ready at my end. We go to Cork on Sunday for a day. Am to get proofs next week. If you see Vidacovich tell him that I cannot reply as my partners and I have not yet come to terms on the changes in contract. This house is now entirely on my shoulders, and my dieta is given in small bits. Jim",
