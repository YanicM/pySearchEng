  "text": "The Nausikaa episode was sent to Budgen three weeks [ago] but not acknowledged. His address is bei Frei, Forchstrasse 168. Please apply to him for it and return it to me under registered cover when read. I arranged it so before I left Zurich. As regards E.P. I suggest you hang it up temporarily protecting the title and awaiting events. If you write an article about its doings I shall send it to the Anglo French Review where it may attract the notice of some Maecenas. The U.S.A. govt burned all last issue of Little Review and threatens to suspend license if Ulysses continues. Swedish translation of Portrait and Italian ditto of Exiles next month. Working on Oxen of the Sun. Position here very unfavourable. Friendly regards to Mrs Sykes and yourself. J.J.",
