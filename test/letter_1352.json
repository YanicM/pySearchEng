  "text": "Dear Budgen: If you are all right in this heat wave could you make for me a pr√©cis of the plot of the book I sent you, marking the margins wherever you like in blue when the marked passage is noteworthy and bears on the plot as you sent it red [sic] and in red when there is some special attraction in the style or better in the dialogue? In this way I can get an idea of the book in an hour or so. Terribly overworked on proofs of W i P. which I should finish by end of year. Hope Mrs Budgen and Joan are thriving also yourself sincerely yours James Joyce",
