  "text": "Dear Mr Lennon, I suppose you have seen about the treasury grant for opera. I sent a great deal of material to Mr Snowden and I think this is now the moment for you to try the persons you suggested. If attention be made to our friend in the press his stage name ‘Sullivan’ by which he is known abroad should be used in preference to his real name which often confuses readers as they think of Denis O’Sullivan. I also think his Christian name may be dropped. Nobody ever uses Enrico or Giacomo when alluding to Caruso or Lauri-Volpi and Sullivan is a ‘divo’. I have been here consulting my doctor who finds I have made progress but postpones operation till the spring owing to the bad weather so I am returning to Paris today. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
