  "text": "Dear Stannie: The above address will find me even if we go away till 25.ix when we return to Paris. I want to know have you sent the connotatoi of Mr Corti and his redentissimo brother to Giorgio and have you sent me the press report of Cav. Pasini’s speech and is it safe for me or Giorgio to recommend Rosso Veneziani to people in Paris. His two sisters, Mrs Schmitz and Mrs Bliznakoff, told us with deep sighs that he was hopelessly off his head. If Mrs S. told you I promised to write a preface for any book of I.S. she lies. When I see Cav. P’s discourse I shall see his publisher here who has written me several times. Did you get H.C.E. and the N.R.F.? Salve! Jim",
