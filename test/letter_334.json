  "text": "Dear Mr Palmer: Many thanks for your kind letter and apologies for the delay in answering. I am glad to hear that our poor songs are going to be brought out. You are kind enough to ask me which I prefer. I prefer (1) O, it was out by Donnycarney (2) At that hour when all things have repose (3) Gentle lady, do not sing. But please do not let my preference interfere in any way with your own desires. I hope you will let me know more of this matter as I could probably sell a few copies here among my friends. After ten years’ silence I wrote a little song the other day and sent it to the Saturday Review. Perhaps you saw it. It was in the issue of September 20. You may like it and find it worthy of note. I have no news of my book yet but as soon as I have I shall not fail to write you as I feel that you take an interest in my writing. It is a long lane that has no turning. I am glad you like the South of Ireland. My father is a Munsterman and my people came from Fermoy. I know only Cork and Youghal—and like Youghal very much. I should be glad to have some cards of Mallow.",
