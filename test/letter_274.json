Ask Stannie to wire me what he can next week. Hope you got safely my present and telegram and the £11 sent you through Caris. Hope to start this day week. Thanks for your good wishes for Xmas and I hope you got over it fairly well. Tell G. and L. that I am coming soon and to keep their noses clean. I hope they had a pleasant time. Addio, Jim Keep a little torrone and mandorlato for Eileen.",
