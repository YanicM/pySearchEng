  "text": "Dear Stannie: I am recovering from a painful illness—inflammation of the intestines aggravated by work and worry. I have no money. On the 14th inst. I had to sell out £300 more of stock but have not yet got my cheque from the lawyers. As soon as it comes I will send on the 600 francs. I was forbidden all work. Some months ago I suspended the free-waiting list of transition which was costing me about 400 francs a month. The person referred to is Miss Weaver who has come to Paris on account of it and my illness, and this note was caused by my offer to James Stephens to take over the book. To my surprise he expressed the most unbounded admiration for it. His words are too extravagant to repeat but he spoke very generously. Jim",
