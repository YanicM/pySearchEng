  "text": "Dear Stannie I sent you yesterday copies of the F.J. containing fuller accounts of the Abbey riots. The debate must have been very funny. Our old friends Skeff. and Dick Sheehy seem to have just been taking a walk round themselves since October 1904. I read Sheehan’s with pleasure and surprise. I would like, however, to hear the phrases which drove out the ladies with expressions of pain on their faces. The pulpit Irishman is a good fellow to the stage Irishman. I see that Synge uses the word ‘bloody’ frequently, and the great phrase was ‘if all the girls in Mayo were standing before me in their shifts’, wonderful vision. Yeats is a tiresome idiot: he is quite out of touch with the Irish people, to whom he appeals as the author of ‘Countess Cathleen’. Synge is better at least he can set them by the ears. One writer speaks of Synge and his master Zola(!) so I suppose when Dubliners appears they will speak of me and my master Synge. Of course just the very week I wanted it most Aunt J did not send Sinn Féin. As I told you before I think the Abbey Theatre is ruined. It is supported by the stalls, that is to say, Stephen Gwynn, Lord X, Lady Gregory etc who are dying to relieve the monotony of Dublin life. About Synge himself I cannot speak. I have read only one play of his Riders to the Sea, which made Yeats first think of the Greeks (who are always with us) and then of the early plays of the most Belgian of Shakespeares. Synge asked me to read it in Paris and when I told him what I thought of it and expounded a long critical attack on the catastrophe as he used it he did not pay the least attention to what I said. So perhaps his later work has merit. If Synge really knows and understands the Irish peasant, the backbone of the nation, he might make a duodecimo Björnsen. Colm is out of the question and Russell and Coosins. Sheehan seems to be a little different from the other young men with ideas in Ireland. I suspect he must have got a high place in all his exams and so can afford to treat the church on equal terms. This whole affair has upset me. I feel like a man in a house who hears a row in the street and voices he knows shouting but can’t get out to see what the hell is going on. It has put me off the story I was ‘going to write’—to wit, The Dead. John Long has not even answered my second letter. What am I to do? I am reading at present some of the old Italian story-tellers, such as Sermini, Doni etc and also Anatole France. I wonder how he got his name. Crainquebille, of course, is very fine and parts or rather phrases of his other books. However I mustn’t complain since he suggested Ivy Day in the Committee-Room, and has now suggested another story The Dead? It is strange where you get ideas for stories. Stupid little Woodman gave me The Boarding-House, Ferrero The Two Gallants. Others I thought of myself or heard of. I have some kind of thing stirring in my head at present, but winter is my close season. I expected a letter from you today, but none came. No papers from Aunt J—. I received a letter from Pappie the day before yesterday, in which he asked me for a £1.–/–/. I wrote, re-iterating what I had said about Charlie and one of the children and saying that I could not send anything before the end of the month. The fact is I have little or no money this month. Nora being tired of our room took another one so that I am under double rent. On Friday we change and I must pay fresh rent L35.–. Moreover, relying on Padre Michele’s word when he promised a rich private pupil, I chucked the school. P.M. came to the bank about ten days ago and asked me what I wanted for a private lesson. I said 2½ frs. Since then he has not appeared, so that I am in a beautiful stew. I am determined, however, that this borrowing shall not go on next month: as I intend to have a little liberty for myself both to read, write and rest. This month I am also without my pupil’s money as he will not pay again, owing to holidays intervening, until exactly the 1st of March. However, I have new hat and boots and vests and socks and a Danish Book and Georgie has a new coat and hat and I gave a dinner. Now when you get this you will have to send me 10 crowns. I don’t even know my future address, except that it is in the Corso! Write a short letter on good thick note-paper and place the note inside, addressing it to me c/o Messrs Nast Kolb & Schumacher, Via S. Claudio, Rome. I shall send you a card during the week telling you what else I shall want. You said you could give me 20 lire this month if I gave you proper notice. I shall probably want 30, as you see, I am unforseenly without the school. I daresay you are tired of these letters. I am too. Next month I shall adopt a different plan. I suppose I may rely, then, on your sending me 10 crowns by return of post. If you cannot send it I give up the problem. I might also mention the expenses incidental to my son and heir who has to have a new sheet and breaks panes of window and drinking vessels rather freely. I must break off this letter now as I am not very well. All this trouble and bustle always finds its way into the bosom of my stomach. I was going to squander a lira on the Dusk of the Gods tonight but am afraid that, in my present pendulous mood, I couldn’t stand in the gallery for 3 hours. Let me hear from you to the above effect by return and advise me what I am to do to get back my MS from Long. My last bout with the law cost me 30 frs and Grant Richards nothing. Jim",
