  "text": "Dear Budgen: Excuse my delay in writing and this scrawl. Flat hunting every blessed day with no result. Must leave here on Friday or Saturday. A dreadful job and, of course, Circe put aside completely. Sargent is wonderfully settled for little or nothing and suggests I go there or thereabouts. But Exiles is accepted by Lugné Poë and already translated and ready to put on in December. The novel more or less the same and to go away now would be to mar any chances I have here. I perceive the editor of B. of F. (a Jew by his name) has been up before the beak and fined so whatever else in that way you send had better be enclosed in a copy of the Christian Hero or some such paper. I hope you are working and progressing. I don’t want to move till Circe is finished. If you see the October Dial in any reading room you will find a long film about me. I observe a furtive attempt to run a certain Mr Marcel Proust of here against the signatory of this letter. I have read some pages of his. I cannot see any special talent but I am a bad critic. Still I think a fall of mine would not altogether disappoint some admirers. It seems to me I have made a bad impression here. I am too preoccupied (Bloomesque word) to rectify it. The problems raised in Circe (of good taste, tact, technique, etc.) are taking up all my time. In order to solve them I must be delivered of all other cares.",
