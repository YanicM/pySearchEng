  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have been expecting a letter from you for some time. I hope you are well and got my letter and Pamphlet signed. Also I hope your sister is making good progress. As for me, ça va—but très doucement. The Dial telegraphed it would pay ½d a word for Yabcd but must see my text first. It has gone and I feel about as diffident as a young lady of 19 at her first coming-out. I finished the Euclid lesson but will not attempt anything more for the present. It is far too hot and the franc having fallen to 250 has jumped back to 192 in four days and tomorrow is my daughter’s birthday (19) and on the next day my son comes of age and Miss Beach has gone to S. Patrick’s birthplace, Boulogne, and I am thinking of going to Ostend. Gens de Dublin has gone into an eighth edition and continues to get very good notices! By the way the pieces in Yabcd connected with the Roderick O’Conor passage are respectively pp. 52, 53, 82, 83, 102. If I turned to anything it would be to them now. I certainly have a capacity for work but I wish I had more agility and imagination. I have been for years staring at an old print of the sacrifice of Cain and Abel and it is only a week ago it struck me how tactful it was of Abel to slit the throats of the firstlings (without any divine injunction as yet to kill the Cains of the flock). However I used it in the triangle. I hope you will write soon to say that you are well and have recovered from my ‘prhose’.",
