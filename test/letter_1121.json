  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: â€¦ a letter from Tokio this morning to say that 2 Japanese editions of U appeared there on 5 February 1932. Up to date 13,000 copies have been pirated, the gross receipts being 170,000 frs to date. One of the publishers asked my terms last June. It seems there is a 10-year law limit to protect European copyright after which period any book is free. I asked T.S.E. to get the opinion of his sales manager (the same who made no use of my advt rhyme). He gave his profound opinion that I should demand a very high advance of very high royalties (how much I forget) and said nothing of the 10-year law. The Japanese considered the terms exorbitant, waited till the 2 February jubileed by, and went ahead. No news from U.S.A. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
