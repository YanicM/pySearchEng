  "text": "Dear Stannie, On receipt of your postcard I went to Wyndham’s house three times without seeing him and left a note for him to call next day. I asked him for money. He has none: but he said he would try to get me some and call back that evg at 7 o’c. I waited until nearly nine then I called to his house twice unsuccessfully. I had no money so I borrowed a couple of lire from my landlady and we dined. Today Wyndham wrote saying he was very (no awfully) sorry he couldn’t get me the money. Having no money or way of getting it I went to the English consul and after interviewing him extracted 50 lire from him. I had asked W— for 50 L, my idea being to send you 20 to enable you to get a suit at once. If, however, I sent you 20 now it would not reach you till Friday evg. and you are paid on Saturday morning. Besides that, there would be a lira wasted in my sending it and a half lira wasted in yr sending me back same on Saturday. However, if any thing has gone wrong write to me or wire as I have now more than L 45.1 hope Saturday will see you with a suit. A— is not worth much when he can’t work his wife to the extent of a suit of clothes. I don’t understand your excessive sensibility. For my part I would much prefer to be ill dressed than to be hungry or in danger of being so. Why do you think of going back to Dublin? Your position from the 1st of Nov will be better than mine. You have 160 Cor. = 165 lire a month and I suppose you make 10 more on extra lessons, 175. Trieste is, as you can see, cheaper than Rome. And you have one person to support as against my two and ½. Moreover, you are on perfectly firm ground as a teacher there while I am constantly making the most absurd mistakes here, knowing damn all about banking business. Besides, I presume Ar— doesn’t receive people like the Russian ambassador or Cardinal Vanutelli or such ‘big pots’ in his school but they come here to criticise my wearing apparel. And, in any case understanding as you must the sympathy of an English consul and an Irish bastard you will perhaps realise that I am hardly in a better position than you myself. However I trust we will be all right from the 1st of Nov. I will send you then enough money to buy a few ties and gloves and linen so that you may satisfy those vulgar sons of whores. And if you are in need of money to eat let me know at once. Symons sends me the following letter: and asks me will I send Mathews the MS. I wrote today to E.M. saying S— had sent me the letter and adding that I was re-arranging the verses but would send the MS in a few days. I do not understand your arrangement: write it out clearly again. Why do you allude to hexameter in ‘Sleep Now’? u – u (u) is the foot used. Do you mean ‘All day’ and ‘I hear’ to precede ‘Sleep now’? That arrangement would be rather jolty, I think. Or do you mean me to end on ‘I hear?’ I understand that arrangement better: namely: ‘Sleep now’ ‘All day’ and ‘I hear’. Also do you mean me to include the Cabra poem? Can I use it here or must I publish it in a book by itself as, of course, my dancing days are over. I wrote to Grant R— to know had he decided to refuse definitely my concessions: namely deletion of ‘bloody’ from 3 stories and deletion of paragraph in ‘Counterparts’ against inclusion of Two Gallants and A Little Cloud. If he refuses that, I will hold him to his 1st letter, in which he asked for deletion of Two Gallants, deletion of paragraph in Counterparts and deletion of ‘bloody’ in Grace. I will hold over Two Gallants and A Little Cloud and retain ‘bloody’ in Ivy Day in the Committee Room. If he does not agree to that I will write to the Society of Authors to institute proceedings against him. As you may have seen a Russian general has been following his wife and wife’s lover all over the world with intent to shoot them. Many eminent persons were consulted as to whether this was right of the said general. Among them was Father Bernard Vaughan. He said, ‘If it were my case I would simply “chuck” the woman’. I suppose he was mis-reported by a reporter with a sense for verse. Fr. B.V. is the most diverting public figure in England at present. I never see his name but I expect some enormity. Does Aunt Josephine write to you? She never writes to me and sends Sinn Féin at long intervals. Is there nobody in Ireland who will think it worth his or her while to make a bundle of any old papers that are lying about his or her house and send them to me? I suppose everyone is disillusioned about me now—myself included. The reason I dislike Chamber Music as a title is that it is too complacent. I should prefer a title which to a certain extent repudiated the book, without altogether disparaging it. It is impossible for me to write anything in my present circumstances. I wrote some notes for A Painful Case but I hardly think the subject is worth treating at much length. The fact is, my imagination is starved at present. I went through my entire book of verses mentally on receipt of Symons’ letter and they nearly all seemed to me poor and trivial: some phrases and lines pleased me and no more. A page of A Little Cloud gives me more pleasure than all my verses. I am glad the verses are to be published because they are a record of my past but I regret that years are going over and that I cannot follow the road of speculation which often opens before me. I think I have unlearned a great deal but I am sure I have also a great deal to learn. Your opinion of me seems to be steadily rising again: but, after all, to say that I am not a vulgar mountebank like most of the ‘artists’ of Ireland is little. What really is the point is: whether it is possible for me to combine the exercise of my art with a reasonably happy life. However, as I have not yet reached the age at which I wrote Catilina, the point need not be solved offhand. I bought Hedda Gabier today for fivepence—Gosse’s trans. The translation seems to me wretchedly bad and the introduction idiotic. I wonder do these chaps know the language he writes in at all. I believe Ibsen scandalised Danish critics by his use of Norwegian idioms. My friend Pedersen pointed out locutions to me in Bygmester Solness and said solemnly in that mellifluous tongue of his ‘Det er ikke jodt dansk. Man sijer det ikke i Kobenhavn’. You should hear him pronounce the last word: it takes him about half a minute. I fancy I’s attitude towards litherathure and socialism somewhat resembled mine. Pedersen did not know the meaning of a few expressions. I doubt, however, that he ever fell so low as to chronicle the psychology of Lenehan and Farrington. I suppose you read that as a result of the socialist congress the two sub-editors of the Avanti resigned. Ferri replaced them by Cicotti, formerly editor of the Lavoratore of Trieste and—Labriola, who is to be the German correspondent of the paper. The funny part is that the two who resigned are members of the party of which L is the head. Labriola is a person who interests me very much. What do you consider weak in my letter to O.G. It definitely closes the correspondence I should think. When he wrote to me from New York it was you, not I, that wished he should get a cordial answer from me. Mrs Francini, on hearing the letter, said with emotion ‘Poverino!’ but O.G.’s request was that I should forget the past: a feat beyond my power. I forgive readily enough. The other night, about ten days ago, we went into the wineshop over the way where I told you we dined once. The man has started a restaurant but we don’t frequent it as the prices are a little too high for us. I was reading the Avanti and between whiles casting about for a remark to make. Pace (the propr.) and his two nephews one of whom is a complete bowsy, a Roman Lenehan, were eating at a table hard by. Pace is a wineshopkeeper by night and a clerk in the Ministry of Finance by day. Finally, I said something about the congress. Pace nodded his head (his mouth being full). The bowsy watched me until he saw my head bend again on the paper: then he leaned over his plate and asked huskily ‘Zio, è socialista il Signor Giacomo?’ Pace, having eaten what was in his mouth, glanced at me and upcurled his lower lip and answered ‘È un po’ di tutto’. Bowsy smiled huskily and the other nephew coughed a laugh as he, smiling too, helped his relatives to some salad. This I perceived through my forehead very accurately, but it had not the least effect upon what the poetical and mystical Swede would call ‘my interiors’. On receipt of your next letter I will write to you my plans for the month of November which I hope you will think reasonable. Nora is going to arrange with the woman to cook in the house after the first. I am sure that by doing so, in three months, we should have saved enough to pay the first instalment on everything necessary for a quarter. Then if you will come here I think we, with our united salaries, ought to be able to have some comfort. Furniture is very cheap here, strange to say. We would have more than 100 lire a week between us. Let me know if you think well of this. We could be in a quarter by 1st of Feb or at latest the 1st of March. I hope you will manage on Saturday to get your suit and, if you should be short of money for food, I will send you what I can. Jim",
