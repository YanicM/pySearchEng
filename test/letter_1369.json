  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: If you have finished reading Dr Berman’s book will you please send it back as another person has asked me for it. I hope that your daughter is better but one must have patience. Lucia had a set-back some weeks ago but is now getting slowly better. These cases always have their ups and downs. I suppose you are going up in the Himalayas Helvétiques for Xmas, Do you happen to know anybody who is coming soon to Paris because I should like him to bring me 10 (or more?) Brissago cigars (not the ‘Blaubart’ mark). He can bring 10 without paying duty and they are all ready made up in a carton in every Z’ch shop. Of course I’ll pay and if.. he brings more, tant mieux. Friendly greetings to you both J.J.",
