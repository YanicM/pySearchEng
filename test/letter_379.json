  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker I have just received your letter of 13. and shall send you one or two pieces of verse tomorrow. I did not explain to you my position more fully because I have been in relation with you for so short a time and I thought I ought not to inflict the facts of the case on you and also because a person in such circumstances is at a disadvantage with publishers. I understand that my friends in London are doing all they can for me. It is very kind of them indeed. A letter from Mr Edmund Gosse has been sent to me, extremely friendly, and I have forwarded to Mr Pound all the information asked for. I am grateful also to Mr Wells for another proof of his interest in me. I think I have now arranged about the typing of my play. I am getting it done at once (partly in return for lessons) but of course I get only one copy. This being so lest the typescript should go astray and thus throw on me an expense I could not meet I shall make, if you allow me, the following arrangement. I shall post you each act of the three separately, at intervals of a day or two. Will you please send me three telegrams: thus: First act received and so for the second and third acts? In this way even if one act goes astray my difficulty will be the less. I hope you will induce Messrs Seeker to take up the novel. In case there be any royalty due to me on Dubliners I shall be obliged if you will send it on as the second A/S should come in after 30 June. Possibly there is some small sum due. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
