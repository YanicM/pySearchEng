  "text": "Dear Mother I received on yesterday morning a copy of the ‘Speaker’ with my review in it. Out of the money you sent me I paid 2 frs to Mr Casey and have promised him the rest (5 frs) of what I owe him by Saturday as he says he has a bill to meet. I can get along until Wednesday noon on what I have. Of course the ‘Speaker’ may send me money tomorrow or Wednesday morning—I hope they won’t be as long in paying as they Avere in printing. In any case you might send something small as soon as you get this and I can let you know if the ‘Speaker’ has paid me or not. I sent in the two other reviews to the ‘Express’ on Saturday. Tell Stannie to look out for the three reviews. He can call soon to the ‘Express’ to get payment and some more books—not before I tell him. I shall send some notes to Mr O’Hara on Wednesday (or Thursday if I get only your money) Jim",
