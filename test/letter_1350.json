  "text": "Dear Curran: Here I am at the other rainbow’s end, having passed from the ultrared onward. Many thanks for all safely arrived. I miss V.V. Let it Pass and P.F. Andy McElroe. I may send you a further £1 when I look at the catalogue again. I want the music more than the words (those I had already made large use of) as I want to bind the lot into a volume for Giorgio as a keepsake. Everything under the sun can be found in Paris but binders are very rare and they take years to do a little work, Lord knows why. When you come to Paris bring the P.F. book with you and I shall have a look at it here. As for Who’s Who and Thom’s I really don’t need these at all, certainly not at all urgently. They can wait. By the way you misread my sanguine scrawl. I did not say I was going to be in Paramé but in Paname—an affectionate nickname for Paris something like ‘Blighty’. We shall therefore meet on Oct 1 and following days here if we do not meet elsewhere on some other date. My final proposal was to accompany my wife to the Isle of Man from where she would have an hour’s sea trip alone. The Rwy Hotel on Holyhead Pier has no terrors for us. We have more than once settled down comfortably in the Hotel Terminus at the point of Calais Pier to the great delight of Alexandre and the rest of the lonely staff waiting until my wife was quite satisfied as to the navigability of that channel which so often has a guffaw up its sleeve. We have stayed there for a week at a time. It is most kind of you to offer to put her up. She has now decided that she could not, at least in her present state, face the two belts of water and that we must get a rest. We were to go to Vittel. Now it seems we may leave on Monday for Le Touquet. For some weeks. Since her return from Ireland in 1922, spring (she went off blithely enough but came back shot up in her nerves) she has never been able to cross water—she will not even trust herself into one of the bateaux-mouches. It is a frightful job when we get to the channel on the rare occasion when we go to London and come back. Mr McGee and Mr Guiney of the Lord Warden at Dover (two Irishmen, by the way, manager and secretary) have also had the pleasure of our company for several days’ stay. Le Touquet, in any case, is en route if there should be any urgent need for her presence in Galway. I am trying to finish my wip [Work in Progress] (I work about 16 hours a day, it seems to me) and I am not taking any chances with my fellow-countrymen if I can possibly help it until that is done, at least. And on the map of their island there is marked very legibly for the moment Hic sunt Lennones. But every day in every way I am walking along the streets of Dublin and along the strand. And ‘hearing voices’. Non dico giammai ma non ancora. My wife is very grateful to you for all your kindness towards us. Thanks too for the libretto and the Chancellor’s verses on J.L.T. I remember both of them well. He was a regular firstnighter. I saw Toole play Paul Pry and the Birthplace of Podgers. He was very old and said to be quite rich—hence the digs in the verses. Tamagno, among tenors, had the same reputation. And so has Lauder. But most of them are still vagabonds at heart….",
