  "text": "My dear little Nora I think you are in love with me, are you not? I like to think of you reading my verses (though it took you five years to find them out). When I wrote them I was a strange lonely boy, walking about by myself at night and thinking that some day a girl would love me. But I never could speak to the girls I used to meet at houses. Their false manners checked me at once. Then you came to me. You were not in a sense the girl for whom I had dreamed and written the verses you find now so enchanting. She was perhaps (as I saw her in my imagination) a girl fashioned into a curious grave beauty by the culture of generations before her, the woman for whom I wrote poems like ‘Gentle lady’ or ‘Thou leanest to the shell of night’. But then I saw that the beauty of your soul outshone that of my verses. There was something in you higher than anything I had put into them. And so for this reason the book of verses is for you. It holds the desire of my youth and you, darling, were the fulfilment of that desire. Have I been cruel to you? One cruelty at least I have not been guilty of. I have not killed the warm impulsive life-giving love of your rich nature. Look now, dearest, into the deeps of your own heart and tell me that living beside me you have not seen your heart aging and hardening. No, you are capable of deeper finer feeling now than then. Tell me, my own little Nora, that my companionship was good for you and I will freely tell you all that your companionship has meant to me. Do you know what a pearl is and what an opal is? My soul when you came sauntering to me first through those sweet summer evenings was beautiful but with the pale passionless beauty of a pearl. Your love has passed through me and now I feel my mind something like an opal, that is, full of strange uncertain hues and colours, of warm lights and quick shadows and of broken music. I am so agitated, Nora dear, about how I am to get together money to bring over Eva and myself and also to go to Galway to see your people. I wrote today to your mother but really I don’t want to go. They will speak of you and of things unknown to me. I dread to be shown even a picture of you as a girl for I shall think ‘I did not know her then nor she me. When she sauntered to mass in the morning she gave her long glances sometimes to some boy along the road. To others but not to me’. I will ask you, my darling, to be patient with me. I am absurdly jealous of the past. Be happy, my simple-hearted Nora, till I come. Tell Stannie to send me a whole lot of money and quickly so that we may meet soon. Do you remember the day I asked you indifferently ‘Where will I meet you this evening?’ and you said without thinking ‘Where will you meet me, is it? You’ll meet me in bed, I suppose’. Magari! magari! Jim",
