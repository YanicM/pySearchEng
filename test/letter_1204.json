  "text": "Cari fanciulli: We have been here now 11 days. Before your wire came I had arranged for both telegrams to be sent to Lucia in both our absences. I warned your concierge not to rébuter a wire if one came on the 27. It did as you will see by Lucia’s reply to my telegram today of inquiry whether she had sent a telegram on the 27. I hope the birthday passed off all right. We are taking the waters here and I wish I could persuade my wife to take the carbo-gaseous baths which are said to be very soothing to the nerves. Perhaps I shall. Helen, you are wrong if you think your cousin is in Germany. I mean Mr Hertz. A few nights before we left Paris I was dining in Fouquet’s when at 11.30 in he walked. He had been stopped at Amsterdam by bad news from wherever his place is and at once took the night avion for Paris and made straight for Fouquet’s, Léon was there too so we had a chat. He seemed to have been deeply disappointed in America (much to our surprise) and as for Germany he became inarticulate. He left for Vichy or somewhere near next day. He said he would go to Denmark but did not care to cross Germany. Where he is now, I don’t know. I am glad to hear that Stevie sits on the beach with his face towards the old world, quand même. While I think Giorgio might have chosen un andantino allegro rather than an andante capo for his bass viol interlude in the last letter, considering the susceptible nature of one, at least, of the addressees, it is or should be patent that the conduct of public affairs in all the great countries of the world between Russia and America both included makes stupid, boring, irritating, backward England seem like a land still inhabited by non-bloodthirsty homines sapientes. I shall go there too when and if France gets unlivable-in but not till then. So I had to take a flat. Enclosed are many things. I am running with this to the post for the boat. We are both well and hope you are. My regards to Mr Kastor. Caro Giorgio, ti scriverò domani Dear Helen, I will write you the day after tomorrow Caro nipotino, ti scriverò überübermorgen Shake and shake and shake Babbo.",
