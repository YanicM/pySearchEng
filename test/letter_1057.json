  "text": "Dear Stannie: Another Triestine lunatic turned up last night in the person of Bruno Veneziani. His sisters and Eileen also told me he was in a madhouse. He says he has just come to Paris to stay and study something and has just given a concert in Milan. He wants advice etc, letters of presentation to Gide, Milhaud etc. I feel inclined to give them. He seems normal enough socially at least, and it would make up for the prefazione mancata. Please add a word yes or no to your wire as I leave here in a day or so. In haste Jim",
