  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: This is only business. Here are 3 groups of letters. 1) Cerf: In case the govt intends to take the case to the Supreme Court would it not be well to take the active side now. If Judge Manton is ‘notorious’ why not direct public attention to the grave judicial error he made (at least so I think) in calling out page, chapter and verse of the book in an open court. If a publisher had used similar tactics in advertising his wares what would this judge have said of him? I think you ought to see Colm anyhow. Nyon: We are to go on there in a week. I shall not make any changes till you return but it is about time I knew what is going on. I have besides an 8-page letter from Lucia, received today. I will send this on if I can read it or find anyone who can. My wife can read some parts. It is scribbled in pencil. Lucia seems to sit by the window all day. This too is the second ‘titre d’essai’ in the way of injections ‘à par hasard’. How many more. Lettrines·. It is the opinion of Gillet, Jolas and Budgen that there is something sinister behind this ‘loss’. Reece was extremely put out by Cerf’s move in publishing Ulysses in the U.S. and then tried to do a little ‘gun-running’—which failed. I can have the written opinion of Van der Pyl and Gillet (2 of the foremost French art critics) of Matisse (who admires her work very much) of Fernand Leger and of J-E Blanche. Unfortunately no press notice of her cover etc for my fragment appeared in the English press because all the available copies were sold out before its publication and Faber and Faber or Feebler and Fumbler did not circulate the 35 press copies because they did not want to be bothered by requests for copies they could not supply. I fully expect to hear that I am wrong and perhaps I am too. Please return all these letters carefully to Léon. I am glad you are all so well and sunburned. I am at present attending night school where they teach ’em how to make pothooks. After which I take out a course of lectures in political science and European history and military strategy. Then I am doing a correspondence to learn how to send perfectly clear straightforward transatlantic cablegrams. This is a lovely quiet rose-growing part of dirty old Europe so we shall probably leave it tonight or tomorrow. I thank you for the cabled money. It is in Paris. As a result of the U.S. court’s decision the English publisher, egged on by his countless lawyers, crawled out with a project for immediate publication (the one I suggested a year ago) and is bucking up his shirtsleeves for a splendid stand. These are fine fellows when you get to know them after 30 years. In addition to S’s daughter and Gillet’s son-in-law Mrs Bailly’s son is dead after 3 days of ‘fièvre cérébrale’. I hope after this 3rd victim the only allbones will take a nice long holiday on the Styx riviera. O won’t we have a merry time, drinking whisky, beer and wine, on Coronation, Coronation Day! Good night, dear children. Nighty night, everybody Babbo",
