  "text": "Dear Curran: From my solicitors’ letter today it looks as if they had sent you 10/– instead of 10gns. If this is so please send me a police constable and I shall reply by a medical officer for the difference. I forgot to say that M. Jolas left with my concierge for my perusal a copy of A Page of Irish History, a book about U.C. On p 338 I read that in 1897 I opposed Skeffington for the auditorship of the L.&H. Society. This is incorrect. In 1897 I was still in the Senior Grade at Belvedere. I never opposed Skeffington. My contest was some years later against Kennedy. He won by ca 22 to 16 all the U.C. staff voting for him. J.J.",
