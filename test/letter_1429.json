  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Have you a copy of the Epilogue to Ibsen’s Ghosts? If so, can you send me a typed copy. Have you two versions? If so, send the longer of the two. My own is unfindable. Also if you are in London at present till what date will you be there? I am having a share of trouble over Gorman’s biography which they are trying to rush for publication in N.Y. in July. I have cabled that I shall refuse to authorise its publication unless I am given an opportunity of seeing the proofs. I think I sent you the Epilogue from Z’ch a few years ago. With thanks in advance and kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
