We are within an hour or so’s train ride of Aix-la-Chapelle where Charlemagne is buried and Cologne. But I dislike going over the border even on a half-day motor coach trip. I wish everyone was as good humoured and as good tempered as me and you. Don’t go to Austria for your holidays whatever you do. Jim",
