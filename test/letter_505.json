  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: First of all I must apologise for not having written before now. I have been very busy looking for new quarters as you may see by my changed address and with other minor matters in connection therewith. It is difficult to get anything that one needs for the winter at present. Copies of Exiles came a few days ago and I sent you a copy which I hope you have now received. It is not well printed or bound but I have no copies of the American edition. I owe you my thanks for your kind words about my play and assure you that I appreciate them very much. I have seen the notice in The Times to which you allude and also one in The New Statesman. I have not yet seen any American notices. I have had no letter from Mr Pound for a long time and I hope he is not ill. I am surprised that you have not received from him the seventh episode (Eolus) which I sent a long time ago. I sent yesterday the eighth episode (Lestrygonians) so perhaps you can ask him to send you both together. I am glad to hear that Mr Fels wishes to make a French translation of my novel. I had a letter from Mr Brandes saying that he would be very interested to read it but had not received the copy sent. Can you send me four copies and I shall remit the amount on the 1 November? As regards the continental press notices I shall have copies made for you. I enclose some new notices. Very many notices—but very small sales I fear will be your opinion. Mr Vidacovich’s article has not yet appeared in the Nuova Antologia nor Mr Davray in the Mercure de France but I hope they will some day. Chi vive sperando muore cantando. May I ask you also when writing to Mr Pound to tell him that I have not yet received the numbers of the Little Review for September or October? My book Ulysses appears to be giving you a great deal of trouble. I must also apologise for the slow rate at which I deliver the chapters. But I hope they will all be dispatched some day. I am writing now the Hamlet episode (Scylla and Charybdis). Excuse me for inflicting another dull letter on you about my writing. It seems I write only about delays and difficulties and disappointments. P.S. Will you please send a copy of the book also to Mr Carlo Linati, via Santo Spirito, 4, Milano, and the press notices, suggesting to him to translate it into Italian for the Studio Editoriale Lombardo. He translated The Playboy of the Western World for that firm. I am writing to him also. J.J.",
