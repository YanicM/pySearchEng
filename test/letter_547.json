Another thing I wanted to know is whether there are trees (and of what kind) behind the Star of the Sea church in Sandymount visible from the shore and also whether there are steps leading down at the side of it from Leahyâ€™s terrace. If you can find out these facts for me quickly I shall be glad. Renewed wishes for 1920 from all here.",
