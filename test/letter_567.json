  "text": "Dear Mr Sykes: I wrote you twice express to Rome but had no answer. The article you wrote at my suggestion appeared in the Daily Telegraph of 1 April and attracted attention. Mr Davray, editor of Anglo-French review, to whom I sent it chose that means as more likely to win attention to it. He writes that the editor of D.T. wishes to get into touch with E.P. Will you see to this matter? It would be well to send a line of thanks to both. I hope Mrs Sykes and yourself are well. The Oxen of the [Sun] is finished. It will be sent to you, when read, by Budgen. Please return it here registered. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
