  "text": "Dear Mother I have not heard anything yet from the paper you call ‘Men and Women’ but I shall write early next month—perhaps next week. I still continue with M Douce and M Auvergniot but I do not see any likelihood of my getting any more tuitions. I have drawn on my tuition money and am paid by M Douce up to 27 March and by M Auvergniot up to 16 March. Therefore when my hotel bill falls due I cannot meet it as I thought I could. However last night I made up my second month’s account and I have reduced my expenses from 161 francs to 106 francs (Hotel bills included)—a reduction that is of 56 francs—about £2–3–0. As against this however my debts in France remain now 19 francs: they were 18 francs at the end of last month. I paid off 7 francs as I told you and borrowed as much again. My reduction of expenses, however, is accompanied by a lack of clean linen—I have had one handkerchief for three weeks—but I have a grey tie which is something under a mile in length—it floats all over me so that it is difficult for the world to discover the state of my shirt. One boot is beginning to go—I knew that that bootmaker wouldn’t put leather in them. I have taken to wearing the ‘good’ black suit as the ‘other’ is impossible. The trouser-buttons of the ‘good’ black suit are falling out one after the other—however I have two safety pins and I shall stitch in buttons now that I have money to buy them. As for the food I get—I do not always get food only when I can. Sometimes I take one meal in the day and buy potatoes cooked and dry bread in the street. I do not know if I am getting lean or not. But, I can assure you, I have a most villainous hunger. Today I came laughing and singing to myself down the Boulevard Saint-Michel without a care in the world because I felt I was going to have a dinner—my first dinner (properly speaking) for three days. This shows what simpletons we all are. I sent in my review of Lady Gregory’s book a week ago. I do not know if Longworth put it in as I sent it: the review was very severe. I shall write to Lady Gregory one of these days. I am sending the two other reviews with this letter. I have not shaved nor do I intend to. When the ‘Speaker’ pays me I shall have a bath. I answered Fr Ghezzi’s letter. I shall answer Aunt Josephine on Monday. Every Sunday I try and get out into the country. Last Sunday I went out to the woods of Clamart and walked through them to Sèvres—coming back by steamer. I read every day in the Bibliothèque Nationale and every night in the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève. I often go to vespers at Notre Dame or at Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois. I never go to the theatre—as I have no money. I have no money either to buy books. Synge was over here selling out and gave me his play to read—a play which is to be produced by the Irish Literary Theatre. I criticised it. Synge says I have a mind like Spinoza! (Spinoza was a great Hebrew philosopher): I am at present up to the neck in Aristotle’s Metaphysics, and read only him and Ben Jonson (a writer of songs and plays). Gogarty wrote to me a day or two [ago] and tells me that ‘John Eglinton’ said the other day (Stannie will tell you who he is) ‘There is something sublime in Joyce’s standing alone.’ My book of songs will be published in the spring of 1907. My first comedy about five years later. My ‘Esthetic’ about five years later again. (This must interest you!) Yeats (who is impressionable) said he knew me only a little time and in that time I had roared laughing at the mention of Balzac, Swinburne &c. I have more than once upset a whole French café by laughing. An old woman shook her umbrella in my face one day in Dublin—I was laughing so loudly. Come what may I will lunch tomorrow. You will oblige me very much if you will write to me and tell what you think of me. I shall read your letter with great anxiety. Jim Ask Benson about your own glasses, I am sure they are ruining your sight. Get him to prescribe proper glasses for you. Don’t fail to do this. Do you go out as I told you? I think you are in good health. I never saw you look better than the night I went home and you came into the hall. I never saw Pappie look better than on S. Stephen’s Day. Tell him so. He looked brown and healthy and neat. I hope he is still in good health. I was sorry to hear about poor old Thornton. However no-one that has raised up a family has failed utterly in my opinion. You understand this, I think. Why did you ask Stannie about the Irish Literary Theatre plays? Jim Georgie understood me, I am beginning to think.",
