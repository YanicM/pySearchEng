  "text": "My darling Tonight the old fever of love has begun to wake again in me. I am a shell of a man: my soul is in Trieste. You alone know me and love me. I have been at the theatre with my father and sister—a wretched play, a disgusting audience. I felt (as I always feel) a stranger in my own country. Yet if you had been beside you [sic] I could have spoken into your ears the hatred and scorn I felt burning in my heart. Perhaps you would have rebuked me but you would also have understood me. I felt proud to think that my son—mine and yours, that handsome dear little boy you gave me, Nora—will always be a foreigner in Ireland, a man speaking another language and bred in a different tradition. I loathe Ireland and the Irish. They themselves stare at me in the street though I was born among them. Perhaps they read my hatred of them in my eyes. I see nothing on every side of me but the image of the adulterous priest and his servants and of sly deceitful women. It is not good for me to come here or to be here. Perhaps if you were with me I would not suffer so much. Yet sometimes when that horrible story of your girlhood crosses my mind the doubt assails me that even you are secretly against me. A few days before I left Trieste I was walking with you in the Via Stadion (it was the day we bought the glassjar for the conserva). A priest passed us and I said to you ‘Do you not find a kind of repulsion or disgust at the sight of one of those men?’ You answered a little shortly and drily ‘No, I don’t’. You see, I remember all these small things. Your reply hurt me and silenced me. It and other similar things you have said to me linger a long time in my mind. Are you with me, Nora, or are you secretly against me? I am a jealous, lonely, dissatisfied, proud man. Why are you not more patient with me and kinder with me? The night we went to Madame Butterfly together you treated me most rudely. I simply wanted to hear that beautiful delicate music in your company. I wanted to feel your soul swaying with languor and longing as mine did when she sings the romance of her hope in the second act Un bel di: ‘One day, one day, we shall see a spire of smoke rising on the furthest verge of the sea: and then the ship appears’. I am a little disappointed in you. Then another night I came home to your bed from the café and I began to tell you of all I hoped to do, and to write, in the future and of those boundless ambitions which are really the leading forces in my life. You would not listen to me. It was very late I know and of course you were tired out after the day. But a man whose brain is on fire with hope and trust in himself must tell someone of what he feels. Whom should I tell but you? I love you deeply and truly, Nora. I feel worthy of you now. There is not a particle of my love that is not yours. In spite of these things which blacken my mind against you I think of you always at your best. If you would only let me I would speak to you of everything in my mind but sometimes I fancy from your look that you would only be bored by me. Anyhow, Nora, I love you. I cannot live without you. I would like to give you everything that is mine, any knowledge I have (little as it is) any emotions I myself feel or have felt, any likes or dislikes I have, any hopes I have or remorse. I would like to go through life side by side with you, telling you more and more until we grew to be one being together until the hour should come for us to die. Even now the tears rush to my eyes and sobs choke my throat as I write this. Nora, we have only one short life in which to love. O my darling be only a little kinder to me, bear with me a little even if I am inconsiderate and unmanageable and believe me we will be happy together. Let me love you in my own way. Let me have your heart always close to mine to hear every throb of my life, every sorrow, every joy. Do you remember that Sunday evening coming back from Werther when the echo of the sad deathlike music was still playing in our memories that, lying on the bed in our room, I tried to say to you those verses I like so much of the Connacht Love Song which begin ‘It is far and it is far To Connemara where you are’ Do you remember that I could not finish the verses? The immense emotion of tender worship for your image which broke out in my voice as I repeated the lines was too much for me. My love for you is really a kind of adoration. Now, dearest, I want us to be happy. Try to get yourself into better health while I am away and please obey me in the small things I ask you to do. First, to eat as much as you can so that you may become more like a woman than the dear awkward-looking simple slender little girl you are. If that cocoa is out get Stannie to send an order for more: the cost is 5s/6d. In the meantime drink plenty of the other cocoa and chocolate. Pay some off the bill to your dressmaker. I sent you today two books of patterns to choose from. On Saturday I send you seven or eight yards of Donegal tweed to have a new dress made from. I have been inquiring about a set of furs for you and if my business turns out well here I will simply smother you in furs and dresses and cloaks of all kinds. I have some very fine furs in my mind for you. Write now, my dear love, and tell me you are doing what I ask. Tell me you are happy because you see that I love you and am true to you and think of you. I am true to you, Nora, and I think of you all day and always. Goodnight, darling. Be happy for this short time we are divided, and whenever you think of me give a kiss to my image in Georgie. Addio, mia cara Nora! Jim",
