  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: These lines to wish you a happy Easter. The dentist’s operation is over—so let us say no more about it. Dr Borsch’s operation was fixed for Tuesday. Now it seems he is going away for some days but it is not sure. I shall know at 3.30. In any case I hope he will do it by Thursday. The piece for the Criterion nearly drove me crazy. It came back from the typist (to whom I was too blind to explain its labyrinths) in a dreadful muddle. Yesterday with 3 magnifying glasses and the help of my son we chopped it up and today Mr Morel will come and sew it up on his sewing machine. I want to send it off before I go into the clinic. I shall send you a copy, I hope, by Monday. If impatience is a sign of imminent health I am very sound. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
