  "text": "1st consultation Left eye, the good one, slightly improved since Sept. 1932. No exudate or precipitation in gap. Artificial gradually opening upwards. Rate of progress slow. This is an advantage as rapid rate of progress might bring complications. It wd continue 3 or 4 yrs until pupil reached 4 mm. Could be hastened by operation but far too dangerous. After 3 yrs a tiny operation (removal of outer film) may be possible and advisable. Prognosis good. 2nd consultation Right eye disimproved. Cataract almost completely verkalkt (calcified), no vision. Little sensibility to light. Retina (invisible, certainly in part atrophied. Test of injection made at 1st consultation however gives not unfavorable result as regards probability of glaucoma. Therefore operation still possible—if not made, eye will be blind. If it is made—very difficult; also dangerous for operated eye which may go blind during op. because of loss of vitreous. If it succeeds still no means of knowing what vision eye may obtain, this depending on retinal condition. For such an operation greatest tranquillity needed. Asked advantage of such an operation, Vogt said 2 eyes better than 1. Asked about retour d’age and my physical state, Vogt said he found me looking younger and better (!!!) But that I shd have complete calm. Asked if op. might imperil left eye, V. replied (reversing what he said in Sept. consultation) that if there was a traumatic iritis in right eye after op. wd probably extend to left and undo all the good he believed. Refused to advise, but sd if in my place and cd be sure of operator like himself wd run risk. I am to reflect and let him know in few days. He wd operate now or in Sept., when in any case I must return to Zurich to have my eye examined.",
