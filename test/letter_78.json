  "text": "Dear Stannie Your card announcing your receipt of my story relieves me greatly. I expect a dilated reference thereto. I have also received birthday honours from you, Charlie and Aunt J—thanks. On the 2nd Nora, Eyers, Fräulein Globocnik and I went by a little steamer to the island of Brioni (famous for cheese). Every tiny feast is a holiday in this country. It seems a long two years since I was in Paris. Your criticism of my novel is always interesting. The sentence ‘to sustain in person &c’ is not legitimate if the phrase, ‘and to protect thereby’ is between commas but is legitimate if the phrase is in brackets. I shall change the verb however. Mrs Riordan who has left the house in Bray returns you have forgotten, to the Xmas dinner-table in Dublin. The immateriality of Isabel is intended. The effect of the prose piece ‘The spell of arms’ is to mark the precise point between boyhood (pueritia) and adolescence (adulescentia)—17 years. Is it possible you remark no change? Again, no old toothless Irishman would say ‘Divil an elephant’: he would say ‘divil elephant’ Nora says ‘Divil up I’ll get till you come back’. Naïf sequence! Your criticism of the two aposopeias is quite just but I think full dress is not always necessary. Stephen’s change of mind is not effected by that sight as you seem to think, but it is that small event so regarded which expresses the change. His first skin falls. Fulham is not old Sheehy—he comes in later. Are my documents on the road? The elaborate intentions of your antepenultimate and penultimate frigidities are a compliment. But you are not careful or just. Curran, in my opinion, behaved to me in a generous fashion: Cosgrave, whom you must recognise as a torpid animal once for all, was, so far as I can remember, guilty of no duplicity towards me. Do you think I am saying what is true? You are harsh with Nora because she has an untrained mind. She is learning French at present—very slowly. Her disposition, as I see it, is much nobler than my own, her love also is greater than mine for her. I admire her and I love her and I trust her—I cannot tell how much. I trust her. So enough. You might amplify the allusion you make to Finn’s Hotel as she wants to know what went on there. I sent a song ‘Bid adieu’ to Harper’s but it was returned. I wrote to Baillie of the Venture twice but no answer. I wrote to Grant Richards (who, Symons wrote to me, was bankrupt) and he answers:—I must apologise for not having sooner answered your letter with reference to the MS of your verses. I regret to say that it is not at present possible for me to make any arrangements for the publication of the book: but I may say that I admire the work exceedingly and if you would leave the matter open for a few weeks it is possible that I might then be able to make you some offer. The MS, I regret to say, has by some mistake been packed up with some furniture of mine that has been warehoused and it is not easy for me at the moment to get at it, so that in any case I shall be glad if you can leave the whole question over for a short time—You might find out [if] he is really in business still and also get me the address of the English 111. Magazine. Is Skeffington still registrar? Is Maggie Sheehy married? I wrote postcard once to May—why did she never answer me? Are the ‘girls’ ‘snotty’ about Nora? Look through the reviews to see if ‘La Figlia di Jorio’ has been reviewed. I want to write an article to get money. There is an anxiety at the back of my mind for which I want to be ready materially. I wish some damn fool would print my verses. I intend to dedicate ‘Dubliners’ to you—do you mind—because you seem to find the stories to your taste. Do you think they are good? or are they only as good as the stories in French daily papers. You must know that I can’t answer such questions in my worse than solitude of the intellect. It is fine spring weather here. I wish I could get to Italy by summer. An Austrian officer and his mistress live in the next room. She is pretty and cheerful: they laugh at night and chase each other about the room. I am ‘working in’ Hairy Jaysus at present. Do you not think the search for heroics damn vulgar—and yet how are we to describe Ibsen? I have written some fine critical sentences lately. They have discovered a novel of Disraeli’s. I find your letters dull only when you write about Nora or Henry James but no doubt both of these subjects bore you as you have no special affinity for either of them. No damn nonsense about writing short letters in future. I write short letters because I have a lot to do. I have English to teach, German to learn (I have learnt a good deal) a novel to translate, a novel to write besides letters and stories, marketing to do—Jaysus. I think I’m a hell of an industrious chap lately. And then Nora! So no more bile beans, brother John, and please smile your citron smile. I have finished Chap XV and Chap XVI and am now at Chap XVII. I was examined by the doctor of the Naval Hospital here last week and I now wear pince-nez glasses on a string for reading. My number is very strong—could you find out what is Pappie’s. As soon as I get money I shall have my teeth set right by a very good dentist here. I shall then feel better able for my adventures. I am anxious to know if you think my writing has suffered any change. My life is far less even than formerly in spite of its regularity. I reach prostrating depths of impersonality (multiply 9 by 17—the no of weeks) but on the other hand I reach levels of great satisfaction. I am sure however that the whole structure of heroism is, and always was, a damned lie and that there cannot be any substitute for the individual passion as the motive power of everything—art and philosophy included. For this reason Hairy Jaysus seems to be the bloodiest impostor of all I have met. Tell him, if you meet him, that I am about to produce a baboon baby by sitting for six hours on a jug full of soda water and ask him will he be godfather. Jim",
