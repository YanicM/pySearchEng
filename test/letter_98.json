  "text": "Dear Stannie Thanks for your prompt return of the story with appendage. I send you by this post the eighth story ‘Ivy Day in the Committee-Room’ which I hope you will return as promptly. I would be glad to have detailed account of your interview with Koehler [sic]. The child has no name yet—I am waiting for funds. I do not want so much as you think but a little would do no harm. If Dubliners is published next spring I hope to be able to help you to get out of your swamp. Do you think it will make money? Nora is writing today to Aunt Josephine. I would be glad of some news of your house generally. Do you think an English publisher will take Dubliners? Is it not possible for a few persons of character and culture to make Dublin a capital such as Christiania has become? Is Cosgrave going to become a dispensary doctor by sacerdotal favour? Are you going to become a despised clerk? I hope to be able to prevent this—but what about myself? Jim",
