If you publish any articles on any subject tell me where I can see them. I hope you will be able to do that for me but if you feel you cannot do so soon please send it back registered so that I may try elsewhere. This copy of a Dublin ‘throwaway’ is a highly entertaining document to John Joyce’s son. Whence comes this phantom ship and why? J.J. PS. By the way what of my mariner in last transition?",
