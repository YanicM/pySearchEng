  "text": "Dear Miss Bollach: I am dreadfully sorry about last night and to hear that you waited so long too. You must have a nice opinion of my manners but really I was prevented at the very last moment when I could not even telephone to you not knowing your number. All I can do is to apologise and hope you are not too annoyed. I called and got the typesheetsâ€”all done to my astonishment! They are excellently done too. Many thanks. Can you meet me on Monday at 6.15 at the same place (I went there today at 1.45 as your concierge told me to do)? I shall go in any case but it would serve me right if you made me wait an hour before you came yourself. With renewed apologies and many thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
