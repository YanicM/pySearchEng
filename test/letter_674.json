  "text": "Dear Larbaud: My typist has sent you extracts (of course uncorrected) from the beginning and middle of Ithaca. In a few days she will send you extracts from the end. I shall send you the proof of the Messianic [scene] from Circe when I get it back. I finished Ithaca last night so that now the writing of Ulysses is ended, though I have still some weeks of work in revising the proofs. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
