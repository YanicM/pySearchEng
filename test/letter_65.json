  "text": "Dear Stannie The school in Trieste and the school here in Pola are the private property of Signor Artifoni, who manages the Trieste school through Signor Bertelli. When I was told to leave I spent days looking for a post as English correspondent in a commercial house. We had a terrible time for some days, I of course borrowing in Trieste right left and centre. I succeeded however in getting one tuition and could have done well in private lessons if I had had money to keep me alive. However the proprietor of the two schools happened to come to Trieste on business and I went to see him. By good luck he is a socialist like myself and explained to me that it would be necessary for me to sign all papers as for married people. He offered me then a post in Pola and I accepted. I left Trieste by the first boat on Saturday morning and as you will see my entrance into Pola was signalised by the enclosed magnificent notice. You will find Pola on the Adriatic coast down towards Turkey. It is a large naval station of Austria and was yesterday en fête during the unveiling of a monument to the Empress Elizabeth. As I had at least four addresses in Trieste, my correspondence is very complicated. I have not yet received the certificates you sent to Switzerland but a friend of mine in Zürich sends on anything that goes there for me. Please send me on at once the number of the ‘Irish Homestead’ which contains my ‘After the Race’. My trunk which I left in Zürich is to arrive here tomorrow or next day. Send on the key at once. Settled here in a furnished room and kitchen, surrounded by pots, pans and kettles. The school is just across the road. Please send on at once a long and documented letter containing all the news as it is nearly a month since I left Ireland and I have had none yet. I have finished (in Zürich) chap. XII and have written part of a new story ‘Christmas Eve’. If you meet any of the mystics or Byrne or Curran you can be airily happy. Tell Pappie I shall write in a day or so, as I want him to do a thing for Dr Rivière. Jim",
