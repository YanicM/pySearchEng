Ithaca is giving me fearful trouble. Corrected the first batch of proofs today up to Stephen on the strand which I read out to you on a memorable night in Zurich (Universitätsstrasse 29) with mirthful comments. Hummel and Giorgio left for Zurich on the 4th. In the words of the Cyclops narrator the curse of my deaf and dumb arse light sideways on Bloom and all his blooms and blossoms. I’ll break the back of Ithaca tomorrow so ’elp me fucking Chroist. Write by return J J P.S. There is an article about me in Today but I haven’t seen it, the rlwy strike (for which YOU are responsible) seems to have disorganised the parcels bloody post again. (English undefiled!)",
