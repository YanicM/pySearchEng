  "text": "Dear Mr Palmer: I have spoken of your settings of my verses to my friend Mr John MacCormack, the tenor, who is here at present. If they have not been printed could you manage to send him in a very clear MS copy three of them, At that hour when all things have repose, Gentle lady do not sing and It was out by Donnycarney, keyed up to tenor pitch. His address is: Claridge’s Hotel 74 Avenue des Champs Elysées Paris I never heard how Mr Milner’s concerts went as I left Zurich abruptly. I returned to Trieste for some time and am now here finishing my book Ulysses for publication. Exiles, my play, will be given here in January by Lugné Poe (Théâtre de l’Oeuvre). I shall be glad to hear from you and to know that your delicate music is meeting at last with the appreciation which it deserves. Sincerely vours James Joyce",
