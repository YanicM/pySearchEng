  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Everyone seems delighted with this place—especially my wife—but the hotels are very difficult, no single rooms in the smaller ones and the prices especially for August far higher than in France. I got them to make a reduction here for a month’s stay and booked a room for you at the same rate from 7 to 14 August. I hope that is right. I saw J.D., J.S. and T.S.E. The first is arranging for me to be seen by some famous doctor when I return to London. J.S. coming down here on Saturday for a weekend to talk about giving lectures. He seemed to be much impressed and moved by my proposal to hand over the work to him if I found my sight or the opposition demanded it and said I could rely on him to help me in anything. But he says I will do it and added that A.L.P. is the ‘greatest prose ever written by a man’! J.D. told me at dinner he thought the last pages of it one of the greatest things in Eng. literature. I thought it better my proposal to J.S. should come now so that if I am forced to it in the end it may appear less abrupt and more spontaneous. T.S.E. most friendly. He wants his firm to publish S.G.’s book and to bring out an English papercover edition at 2/- of A.L.P. Please watch T.L.S., Spectator, New Statesman and Catholic News.",
