  "text": "My funds are low because among other things the little Parisian shopkeepers passed old louis off on me and once or twice Italian lire. I did not receive your telegram till I was going to dinner and as I had an engagement at the Paris Thespians at 9 o’c I could not go to Cook’s. I went today; it was shut. If my ticket is Calais–Dover, I leave here 9 o’c Monday evg, travel without stop and am in Dublin Tuesday evg 8.10 o’c. No use staying a day in London at this time of year as I had another letter from Mr Yeats (whom, however, I shall see) saying editor of ‘Speaker’ will not be back till after Christmas Jim",
