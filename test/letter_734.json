  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: At last I have some kind of good news though not much. I did not write before because I was not sure whether the condition would persist. The dionine treatment prescribed by Dr Colin of Nice has dissipated a fair part of the film. Dr Borsch however will not apply it in the strong solution which the Nice doctor prescribed partly I suppose because he is older and more prudent but also because he knows better the pusillanimous nature of his patient. He prefers to continue the treatment gradually and to wait and see if the film will thin more. He does not believe the dionine will dissipate the film wholly nor was Dr Colin positive of that either. He was however as you see a very clever man and all the London doctors who said the film was ‘organised’ (that is not fluid but irremovable) were wrong. Unfortunately this does not mean any improvement in my power to read or write and for this reason. I had before 1/10 of normal vision in that eye. Now I have 1/7 or 1/6 but this is only good for longrange vision. It enabled me a few nights ago to see the lights of the Place de la Concorde which before had been only a blur. Dr Borsch believes that after the operations I will have 1/2 of normal vision. Personally I am sceptical about the effect of the dental one but since Dr Borsch will not do his operation till the dentist has done his let it be so. The latter will get to work as soon as Dr Borsch is convinced that the dionine can do no more. The threatened attack in the right eye has been kept under partly by Dr Borsch’s local treatment, partly by Dr Colin’s cure. Can a copy of Ulysses (2nd edition) be sent to my brother Charles Joyce? If so it ought to be numbered. The copy Mr Rodker sent me to work on is unnumbered. Does he know the numbers of the copies sequestrated? I think this point is important in such an edition. No press notices of the second edition have reached me. I know nothing about the French and Italian versions but then I rarely see anybody except a few people whom I asked here for diplomatic reasons and in acknowledgment of services rendered to my book among them Mr Huddleston of The Observer who is now Paris representative of The Times. The weather here has been atrocious, bleak, damp, cold etc. I hope it is better in your part of the world. I wonder if you ever weigh in one hand the smaller Oxford blue volume against the Greco-Bavarian telephone directory in the other. If you wish any elucidation I shall be glad to give it—before I forget it myself! Though I shall feel like Eneas when invited by Dido to tell his tale ‘Infandum, regina, iubes renovare dolorem’. Nevertheless he told it. With kindest regards and best wishes and some hopes for a good result of all this treatment sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. An Irish ‘Who’s Who’ has just been issued. It contains 2500 names but not mine. J.J.",
