  "text": "Dear Mrs Raphael I am very sorry to hear of the dreadful accident. Your niece says you are now out of danger. But what a frightful shock! It is well you are not disfigured, and I understand that it is not likely to leave any serious trace. I do hope you will get some compensation in spite of the lack of witnesses and that your suffering is not too great. Let me thank you once again for your quick and excellent transcriptions. You have rendered me a very great service. With my very best wishes for your speedy and complete recovery sincerely yours James Joyce",
