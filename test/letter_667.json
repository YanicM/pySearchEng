  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: A few lines to let you know I am here again with MSS and pencils (red, green and blue) and cases of books and trunks and all the rest of my impedimenta nearly snowed up in proofs and nearly crazed with work. Ulysses will be finished in about three weeks, thank God, and (if the French printers don’t all leap into the Rhone in despair at the mosaics I send them back) ought to be published early in November. I sent the Penelope episode to the printer as Larbaud wants to read it before he finishes his article for the Nouvelle Revue Française. The Ithaca episode which precedes it I am now putting in order. It is in reality the end as Penelope has no beginning, middle or end. I expect to have early next week about 240 pages of the book as it will appear ready and will send on. Eolus is recast. Hades and the Lotuseaters much amplified and the other episodes retouched a good deal. Not much change has been made in the Telemachia (the first three episodes of the book). My eyes seem to be all right for the next three weeks though I know that it is madness to work them as I am doing but I feel around me a good deal of impatience made up partly of expectation and partly of irritation. I am very very slow and have just energy enough to write the dry rocks pages of Ithaca. With kind regards and looking forward to the expiration of my seven years’ sentence.",
