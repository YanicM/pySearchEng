  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for your letter. My eyes are fairly well but as a variety I have been laid up for the past week with fever and tonsilitis. I am better today. As regards my novel since I see you want foreign reviews of it I would make the following suggestions. Copies could be sent to the Semaine Littéraire (Geneva) and the Journal de Genève. I think you ought to enclose in these copies the last pages of Egoist (May and June) with extracts from English and American press notices. If the copies have already been dispatched to Florence and Rome to the addresses given you could post these pages under wrappers. A copy could be sent to Professor Federico Olivieri (professor of English literature), university of Turin, with notices also in the hope that he may notice it. This you might accompany by a diplomatic letter on your official notepaper. The London correspondent of the Corriere della Sera writes under the pseudonym of Giovanni Emanuel. You could perhaps find him by telephoning to Reuter’s agency there. The present editor of the Secolo (Milan) is Mr Mario Borsa who knows English well, I suppose. He wrote a book on the English theatre. I believe that Mr Yeats knows him or Lady Gregory. You could send him a copy with notices and a letter also. You could perhaps mention that he and I were at one time collaborators of the same paper the Piccolo of Trieste, for which he was the London correspondent while I was an occasional leaderwriter for it. I would do all this myself but it is difficult to push one’s own wares. I am surprised that neither Mr Archer nor Mr Symons has done anything to help the book. Possibly they are not in England. Mr Antonio Cappico and Mr Arturo Galanta are persons resident in England who may bring the book under the notice of Italian readers. I forgot to say that you may refer Mr Borsa for any further information about me to the editor of the Piccolo of Trieste, Dr Prezioso who lives now in Milan or near it. I fear my writing is very bad today as I am somewhat feverish still. I am glad you are bringing out a second issue of the book. It would be well to have it set up at once so that I could read the full proof. My agent has my corrections for it.",
