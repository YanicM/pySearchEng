  "text": "My dearest Nora I have written to those people in London stating your willingness to accept their offer. I do not like the notion of London and I am sure you won’t like it either but at the same time it is on the road to Paris and it is perhaps better than Amsterdam. Besides I may have some business to do in London which can be best done personally. Still I am very sorry we must begin in London. Perhaps I may be sent direct to Paris, I hope I will. I was speaking afterwards to Mr Cosgrave and I discover that I have unintentionally wronged him. He appears to have believed what he said to you. Consequently I did not report your advice to him about the way he carries his head. Mr Cosgrave is what is called a ‘solid’ man and he always looks at things from the most sensible point of view. Sometimes this adventure of ours strikes me as almost amusing. It amuses me to think of the effect the news of it will cause in my circle. However, when we are once safely settled in the Latin quarter they can talk as much as they like. I do not like the prospect of spending today without seeing you—last night hardly counts. I hope you are happier in your mind now that the boat is really beginning to whistle for us. You asked me to write you a long letter but really I hate writing—it is such an unsatisfactory way of saying things. At the same time remember that I expect you to write if you can at all. I discover now reading this letter that I have said nothing in it. However I may as well send it since it may relieve the dulness of your evening. The sun is shining coldly through the trees in the garden here. The gentleman in the chapel has just rung the Angelus. My brother is grinning at me from the other side of the table. Now make yourself a picture of me if you can. Adieu donc, ma chérie, Jim",
