  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am glad to hear you are coming over but as I dream all day of the Euston Escorial and the heavenly landscape of smoky engines I cannot understand anybody coming here. I am no worse, possibly a little better but it is almost impossible for me to recover in this climate. The odds are too heavy and yet I am reluctant to go away an ‘unfinished job’. I can write this and even see a few of the letters! It is the first of December today (winter time) and the light is dazzling. Have you time to ask these people (Vocalion) to send me the records marked. I want the Martha one for Mr Morel, the bass for my son and the English tenor one for myself. The day is awfully long and boring and all I can do is to listen to a few records and scribble an odd note. My reason for troubling you is that shops here ask a month or two to import new discs yet a London shop sent me a disc lately (the de Reszke quartet in an English fourpart song—cf. Mr Earwicker’s speech p. 1. ‘our fourposter singing Etc’—which gave my ear and brain great pleasure) in three days! I ‘wrasted the page redhanded’ from the Sunday Times but I hope you will be able to join the fragments. You will find a good article on me in the new London review The Calendar for April. I ‘rush for the post’ and end this abruptly as I see I have quoted myself several times. I hope you are feeling well after your stay in the country. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. It is better to have the discs sent through Miss Beach. She manages the customs better than I could. J.J.",
