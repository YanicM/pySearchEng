  "text": "Dear Stannie The contract with Maunsel was stamped yesterday in the Stamp Office and the book will come out probably in March. The price is 3/6 nett. I am applying for the examinership as soon as the other certificates come. Kettle was most friendly to me but I received no invitation to Sheehy’s though they must know I am in Dublin. In the new National University there will be no chair of Italian only a lectureship in ‘commercial Italian’! at i?100 a year for lectures a few times in the week in the evenings. I could get it but would be ill-advised to take it. I have written to Synge’s brother to know definitely about the play. I also went to the Abbey Theatre and they showed me the costumes used and are giving me the music of the Keen. The manager is reserving a seat for me for the first performance of Blanco Posnet. I have had cards printed with the indication ‘P.d.S.-, Trieste’ and tomorrow am going to see the Manager of the Midland Rwy. I shall say I am on the Italian press and am writing a series of articles on Ireland and try to get a pass to Galway. Poppie went away yesterday to Kilkenny and will not be seen again until she goes to New Zealand. I sent Nora a stone of shell cocoa. Pay the duty on it which cannot be high and see that Nora takes it every morning and evening. Kettle marries Mary Sheehy on the 8 Sept. Kathleen marries Cruise O’Brien. Skeffington has a son two months old. Caruso sang here yesterday. Neither Irish Times, Express, or Mail would allow me to interview him though at the Corinthian Club dinner he spoke to the toast in Italian and his reply was translated. An Italian Opera Co is playing here (Aida Gonzaga of ‘I Puritani’ last autumn) is in it [)] but I have been too distracted to go to it. I told the story of this miserable blackmail to Byrne and his opinion is that Gogarty and the other are in collusion. He was very kind to me in the matter. He says that the other’s price is half a crown. I liked very much his attitude. I think he is in love himself. However—we will kill that too like the rheumatism. Eva must come back with me. It means the future happiness of my house: and Nora expects her to come. I rely on you to do all you can to that end and we shall have a fine winter of it. Nora writes warmly of your kindness to her. Try to cheer her up now and we will put things right. Thanks: and if that was those bowsies’ object they have done just the contrary of what they intended Jim",
