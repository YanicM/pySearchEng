  "text": "Dear Stannie, Monday. Thanks for your remittance which I received today when my funds were at zero. An advt which I answered in the Tribuna has brought me some money. I have been appointed ‘professor’ in an Ecole de Langues (which is an offshoot at low prices of the B.S.). I go there when I am finished at the bank and as I am paid L 1 per lesson it will bring me about L 10 per week. Tonight I leave the bank at 7 o’c: and then have lessons in the Ecole from 7.15 to 10.15. Tomorrow I have my private pupil from 7.30 to 8.30 at home and have then 1 lesson in the Ecole from 9 to 10. Between these two I make about L 14 per week more. I began in the school on Saturday and next Saturday shall probably receive 10 Lire from it. Your 20 Lire will last me till Saturday but I am afraid you will have to send some more as I shall have to pay the Caparra for a room. This will positively be the last month in which I shall have to bother you. Let each of us then save as much as he can. I can save Lire 100.— per month. I see nothing for it but to try to save money. I wrote to John Long, offering him Dubliners. I send you the U.I. Leprechaun and Giornale d’Italia. Yesterday another bomb went off in S Peter’s. Strange to say I went there in the afternoon without knowing of its having happened. I had intended going to the morning service (and would consequently have been in the church at the time of the explosion) but that I waited in for a letter from you. Things are beginning to be pretty lively here. I saw no precautions taken in the church in the afternoon but perhaps these things are not visible. Cardinal Rampolla in the procession passed me at an arm’s length unprotected so far as I could see. He is a tall strong man with a truculent face. At the close of the service a priest came out on a high balcony under the dome and exhibited the sacred relics, the lance, the piece of the cross, and the towel of Veronica. This he did by marching from one end to the other of the balcony with each relic in turn and holding it over the parapet at each end while a bell rang and the procession knelt in the centre of the nave. The upper part of the dome was rather dark and the towel looked rather like a thing out of Tussaud’s. The choir was very good but some of rev. gents have voices like crows. While one was cawing a young ecclesiastical student beside me (who had pointed out Rampolla to me) laughed out loud and made signs of anguish with his mouth. A peasant woman with a kerchief on her head gave milk to a child during the vespers. Rampolla is like Father Murray without the lower jowl: or like Father Brennan: wore a red berretta stuck anyhow on his head. It’s a bloody funny church, no doubt. I expected a letter from you today. I received yesterday By the Stream of Killmeen by Seumas O’Kelly, and have read three stories of it. If you like I will send it to you afterwards. A good deal of publishing appears to be going on in Dublin at present, I would like to read more of the books, even Heblon’s Study in Blue though, as W Archer says I know it’s not good for me. With great difficulty I finished Gissing’s The Crown of Life, this crown being love according to G.G. What irritates me most in him is when he begins to write eloquently about nature. Like William Buckley, the Irish novelist, who writes in Sinn Féin, he makes ‘nature’ very tiresome. A reviewer in Sinn Féin said that S O’K’s story ‘The Land of Loneliness’ was worthy of Tourgénieff. The stories I have read were about beautiful, pure faithful Connacht girls and lithe, broadshouldered open-faced young Connacht men, and I read them without blinking, patiently trying to see whether the writer was trying to express something he had understood. I always conclude by saying to myself without anger something like this ‘Well, there’s no doubt they are very romantic young people: at first they come as a relief, then they tire. Maybe, begod, people like that are to be found by the Stream of Killmeen only none of them has come under my observation, as the deceased gent in Norway remarked. [’] I doubt if S O’K would judge my stories so urbanely, however. I wonder does his book sell. Nora, who read Hedda Gabier with interest twice before forgetting it, considers his stories tiresome rubbish. The École is not chic. Last night one of my classes numbered nearly a dozen pupils. One of them was a lovely boor: elderly, red swollen face, sidelong glance. He made fun openly of my writing on the board, perhaps thinking I ‘had no Italian’, and of me as a ‘professore’. Some of the pupils laughed. A rather fat girl came to my rescue by explaining everything to him over again in Italian. He wanted to know why I didn’t explain in Italian. She told him it was the ‘metodo’. Then he said something which made the class laugh. I was frightfully polite to him and, though I was tired, did my best to make him understand. When he was going away he told me he quite understood that 1 was prevented by the metodo from doing as he wished but that what he wanted etc etc. The Ecole, in fact, is bowsy. It has no books or illustrations. The pupils, I think, pay 50 c– a head for a lesson. However …! Publisher’s announcements are becoming worse. Really they are intolerable. Read the D.M. suppl. ‘Books’ Renan was right when he said we were marching towards universal Americanism. I suppose you read about Caruso being arrested in the monkey-house at New York for indecent behaviour towards a young lady. By the way is ‘Lily is a lady’ a song or a cant. I wonder they don’t arrest the monkeys in New York. It took three N.Y. policemen to arrest Caruso. His impresario ridicules the charge and says Caruso has to answer shoals of ‘offers’ from N.Y. women of the upper classes. The papers are indignant. Do Americans know how they are regarded in Europe? I hear a report that there was a third bomb thrown today in the Piazza di Spagna. I hardly think these can be the work of anarchists. They are very clumsily made and do no damage. It may be a trick of the police to justify them in making arrests on suspicion as the King of Greece is to be here in a few days. I hope to Jesus he won’t pass by this building during his visit as there might be a serious explosion. It is pleasant to reflect that in the event of rupture between Italy and Austria I have my office in the Austrian Consulate. I discover that have nothing further to say now. I expected a letter from you today I shall keep this open till 8 o’clock this evg. I have two lessons tonight. Jim By the way of the 4 advts I answered in the Tribuna, one got me this position in the bank, one got me Terzini, one got me a letter of apology and regret, a miss of L 130.–, and one got me a professorship in the École de Langues!
