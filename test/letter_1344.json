  "text": "Dear Curran: First of all many thanks for having acted as cicerone to these two visitors. Though both have been back in Paris for some days I have not yet seen either. It is regrettable from every point of view that I have to trouble you again about my wretched family affairs…. But to turn to another aspect, less deplorable though equally enigmatic, of our island life my mother-in-law seems to have relapsed into quiet after her cavalry correspondence of some time ago—concannons to right of her, concurrans to left of her. Her youngest daughter sent us a p.c. saying casually she was getting married the next day. No name, no place. A month after we got a Galway paper with an article heavily scored in black ink about the secretary of a G.A.A. who had been suspended because he left a G.A.A. meeting to go over to a Rugby dance where apparently one of the girls was flowering the wall. This official’s name was Sean uasal O Broin. When we had read this several times we said ha ha now we have it. His name is Byrne. Time passed and then one lovely May morning we got a parcel containing a chunk of old but still combative wedding cake for my wife and a silver shoe for me in a letter-packet from Mr and Mrs Griffin. I am wondering what strategical steps my sister-in-law will take eventually to break to us gently the crowning news of her husband’s Christian name. These people would be ideal readers for Work in Progress but for the fact that they feel they could do so much better themselves if only they would take the trouble of so doing. After 15 years I was still tinkering away at it at 5 a.m. this morning. Once when I was last in Ireland I got a present from them of some fowl. Some weeks after I got a laconic ‘p.c.’ saying simply ‘Did you like the drake?’ Anyhow my wife and I get plenty of fun out of them still and Lord knows we haven’t much to make merry over. S. Médard (who has just sent us a shower which means 40 days rain).",
