Lucia unfortunately continues to have a disconcerting and persistent relapse. We are thinking of going to Zâ€™ch for a couple of weeks after my birthday (Maria Lichtmesse) if all goes well. My son and family are in N.Y. I am working night and day and the last thing I shall publish in serial form will be in the coming transition. Kind regards to you both sincerely yours James Joyce",
