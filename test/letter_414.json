  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have received your letter of 15 inst and also the March and April numbers of The Egoist. I thank you for your friendly allusions to me in your leading article and would beg you to convey my thanks also to Miss Marsden. I am glad that you have better hopes with the new printers and that there is a possibility that some American publisher will bring out the book. I shall be most anxious to hear the result of these negotiations and am sure that you will write to me as soon as you have any definite news. I can only hope that the career of the book after its publication may recompense you for the interminable troubles which it is causing you now. With thanks and kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
