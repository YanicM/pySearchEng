  "text": "Dear Mr Walsh: You have not replied to my letter from Niort so I am sending this express. The piece for the October Calendar will be announced in the September Calendar and appear on 1 October with a footnote (v. The Criterion (July), This Quarter (September)). My sight is getting worse, I think, so I shall be very glad if you will have the piece set at once and sent to me. I will correct it and the other piece at the same time. I must have a few weeks complete rest before I return to Paris for the operation. I can write but cannot see well what I write or read. Will you please telegraph me the word ‘arranged’ if you can do this? It does not matter if your review is delayed a few days after 30 September so long as it is dated September and referred to as above. Please do not send your cheque to me here but make it payable to Myrsine Moschos and send it to 12, rue de l’Odeon as Miss Beach is on leave till 20 inst. I have told Miss Moschos about it. Send the proofs, please, registered to Miss Beach at the same address. Many thanks for your kind message. I am glad you found the piece suitable. I regret having to trouble you but hope you will understand my case Sincerely yours James Joyce",
