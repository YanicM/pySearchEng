  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have now seen Mr and Mrs Davidson (the latter wants to do my head—he is not a barber but a sculptor) and have heard a long enthusiastic story. In the middle of it a letter arrived from Miss Lewisohn. I sent her your contract and asked her to fill in or strike out as she pleases. I tried to look interested but my thoughts were elsewhere. This is a great mistake, I know, and I should not do it if I knew better where I was. Of course I have broken my promise and have begun drafting other parts in spite of the heat, noise, confusion and suffocation. My son arrived this morning. When he is rested I think we shall leave him here to hunt around and go away to some quiet place for a week or so. Tours, I think. Perhaps it will be better for you to write 12 rue de l’Odeon. I sent you a copy of the Freeman with a review of Dr Collins’s pretentious book. It is better to say nothing about one’s impressions on arriving here in present circumstances. Mr Davidson swears he will get us a flat with the aid of an Indian friend. Thaumaturgy of [some] kind is needed. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
