  "text": "Dear Aunt Josephine: Thanks for letter to which I shall reply more fully. As regards the gazette or police news or whatever the devil it is it was always on sale in low newsagents. You must be misinformed unless it is a brandnew regulation. Well, can you obtain for me Reynold’s or Lloyd’s Weekly News or News of the World for the weeks ending? Keep them till my next card when I shall tell you where to send them either to Paris or to London. We leave here, I expect, in a fortnight but I must remain a week or so between Paris and London. More anon. Thanks. Jim",
