  "text": "Dear Ford: Many thanks for the kind mention of me in Sundayâ€™s Chicago Tribune. I hope the issue is selling well. The Egoist Press is going out of business and Mr Jonathan Cape wants to acquire copyright of all my books at once. He has forwarded a contract to me and suggests that I submit it to you. May I trouble you to let me know what you think of it. The royalty 15% seems to me rather low. The Egoist Press paid me 25% and Shakespeare and Company 66% of net profit. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Miss Weaver writes that it is not easy to get your review in London?",
