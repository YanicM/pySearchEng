  "text": "Dear Léon: We moved into this cheap hotel today. I understood Ivry would leave when general mobilisation was proclaimed. Therefore went to Hotel Edelweiss into which it is supposed to move. The caretaker had never heard of any Dr Delmas or Maison de Santé. Was not expecting anyone. Mrs Delmas has no telephone. The Delmas villa is about 2 miles outside La Baule. There are no vehicles of any kind today. Walked there and found she knew nothing. He is supposed to be in pourparlers with the Banque Nationale in Paris…. 30,000 persons are supposed to arrive here on Sunday and Monday. A huge hotel (120 rooms) is not likely to be left vacant. Can you find out whether he has taken it or not, whether he has these famous cars which were to be ready to transport his maison and what he is waiting for since everyone is being urged to leave Paris unless he knows the whole business is a farce. You have troubles enough of your own but if you can find this out by telephone so much the better. Nothing else is of much importance for the moment. I suppose your idea of staying in Paris is to show your zeal and readiness. Perhaps you are not there now. I hope the rest of the family are all right. Helen wrote me to say they would go to stay in the country house if war came. She is on way in Etretat and says my concierge has forwarded three letters for me. Why? With best wishes cordialement votre James Joyce",
