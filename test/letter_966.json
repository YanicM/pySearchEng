  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I shall try to get away this week but I can scarcely go leaving the VL-AM mix-up as it is. Here is letter 4 from VL. I cannot find 3. He proposed André Maurois as reviser. I am utterly opposed to any such change. My relations of course are, as always, amicable. We were to have motored down with them and Fargue to Chartres Saturday but it rained too much. The French general elections are coming on which make me nervous like the stalwart hero I am. Ford’s child has to be instructed in Xian doctrine, it seems. He offered me a little house he has in Toulon and asked us to dinner. I don’t see much use for a sponsor at all if the child (who is a nice little girl anyhow) can remove the devil etc on her own account but I accepted his invitation as an act of friendliness. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
