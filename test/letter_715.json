  "text": "Dear McAlmon, I am sorry I could not see you this morning when you called but it takes me nearly an hour to do all the different dressings for my eye. Will you please thank Lady Ellerman for her kind invitation and give my excuses explaining why it is impossible for me at present to go out anywhere. . I am not by any means a social attraction. My wife tells me you are leaving for Paris on Monday. I should very much like to see you before then as I have a few messages to intrust to you It is possible that I may get a telegraphic call to a Doctor this evening at the hour you proposed coming 6 p.m. so that if I am not there I should like to see you to-morrow morning at quarter past eleven for a few minutes. As you see my journey here has turned out disastrous and I should like to explain a couple of matters preferably in conversation. Kind regards, James Joyce",
