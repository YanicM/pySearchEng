Lucia is with the Duncan School in Schloss Klessheim near hereâ€”a castle which belonged to Archduke Louis Victor or rather he belonged to it, domicilio coatto. The people here say he was perfectly sane and a Guter Mann and that is family intrigue. Why so late as the 10th. We may stay over a week or so more (8 days already yesterday). It must be easily the finest town of its size (35000) in Europe. We hope to meet you both. Giorgio is in the Pyrenees (Canterets). Jim",
