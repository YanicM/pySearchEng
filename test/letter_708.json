  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for copies of the Nation. Mr Murry’s article is very useful for I think it will break the boycott. I met him casually a few days ago at lunch and he wrote me the enclosed afterwards. He tells me he has written a second article and wants to do a third. I am glad to hear you are having a long holiday in the country. Mine has not come yet. I send you a copy of the New York Herald with a second article. I enclose the letter but when you write perhaps you would be good enough to send it back. I am glad to hear that Miss Marsden has finished her book and beg you to tender her my respectful congratulations. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
