  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: There was no French outburst on the evening of the 17 Nov. Only laughter. I was annoyed because it was absurd to get up a big dinner and invite a dozen people to hear two sentences. The outbursts are mostly on the other side of the channel at the moment as you may see by the anti-French cartoon in the London press. Affairs will become bad if this country is dragged into the general ruin against its will as must happen in the end. After 3 weeks’ wrangling H.N.’s talk did come off. He has acted admirably, I think, and a telegram of felicitation on his victory and on his courageous lecture was sent him in the name of my French admirers. He spoke for 40 minutes, quoted passages from U and put on the A.L.P. disc. He advocated the abolition of official censors and the creation of a small jury of men and women of letters and said that to persist in the present attitude towards a work like U (which he said he was forbidden to mention by name) was to court the ridicule of other nations. Messrs Mashed Parsnips continue to pester Mr Monro with footling little bills of gas etc and he keeps on sending them over on a wet wicket and I keep batting them back to long on. O that flat! … My impressions of that wretched warbler S. who disgraced the pure boards of Kitchen Garden Opera once and for all will appear in the New Statesman any week. This is my son’s wedding anniversary so I went out with Colum to see a film L’Afrique vous parle. I think I have done a good job for Lucia. She has made initial letters for all the poems in P.P. on large sheets and I wrote the text. These are to be reproduced in facsimile only 25 and Mrs Crosby (who went to N.Y. a few days ago) will try to sell the sets at 60$ or if not she will sell them at 30$ and have 50 made. If all goes well over the cost of reproduction the N.Y. dealer will make 5000 frs, Mrs C. 5000 frs and Lucia 10,000 frs. The letters are very beautiful. This was an idea of mine. Now I must run out to see Soupault who is ill…. Confusion to carrots and long life to everybody.",
