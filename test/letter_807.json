  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: The weather here has been very unsettled and so I remained on: but the air is good and fresh and I feel my mind less tired though walking fatigues me the day after. I hope the storm reported in the press did not rage over your part of London. It seems to have come almost at the same time as it did last year when I was in Bognor. We had the fringe of it in Dinard—a place I dislike. I had projected, strangely enough, something like your itinerary—except for Lannion—as I wanted to visit Dinan and Renan’s birthplace. I am not sure yet whether I shall do so or not. When the weather is bad I read a little in the town library. I like S. Malo. I dislike places that live on tourist traffic only. I wish I had come here earlier and I hope the weather has not broken…. I have reached nearly the end of the Wembley dinner party. The tangential relationships, the spiral progressions and the presence of the absent remind me of something which perhaps I wrote or ought to have written. I do not know on what side of London Wembley is or from which station it is reached. I am getting accustomed to the neighbourhood of Euston though I suppose that borough is quite ignorant of my existence. You say you have seen a great many French notices of Dédalus. I have seen several but not many as yet. The translation seems to be good. There is very bad news current about Mr Quinn’s health. I hope it is not true. Some people take a delight in circulating sensational news especially when it is bad. I see that Dr Rosybrook bought a weather-beaten timetable a few days ago in London for $155,000…. It is regrettable but Dr R.’s appearance in the composite photograph of Ulysses and his equipage at the last moment is ludicrous—and monstrous when he walks off with the vessel’s bill of lading under his arm.",
