There is a long chapter on Zurich. Also in a Roman review Prospettive (15 February) there appears an Italian version I made with ‘E. Settanni’ of the river piece in Finnegans Wake (a prophetic title) which is also reviewed there. I hope Mrs Sax and your sister-in-law are well and you yourself. My daughter-in-law is extremely ill and my daughter not yet better. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
