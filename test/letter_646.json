  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: … I saw Mr Pound. He has read Circe and Eumeus about which he appears to be very excited. He told me he had sent or was sending them to you. I am glad they are gone out of my house. I suppose you have now received Miss Beach’s letter. I do not think it is necessary to say anything about Mr Aldington’s article (I am writing to him in any case to thank him for it) except that it ought to attract some attention to the book. While I consider his article quite fair (though somewhat irrelevant to my mind) perhaps it would be well to pass on to Mr Eliot when you have read them the two episodes Mr Pound sent and also the typescript of Oxen of the Sun which I could send if you approve. I mention this because he told me it was arranged that Mr Aldington was to write an article and he to reply to it. In that case he ought to see the book in its present (penultimate) stage. I heard just now that the Little Review, a monthly which came out every five or six months lately, has suddenly become a weekly or fortnightly publication. I have not been able to see Mr Pound, from whom the rumour originated, but I shall let you know more tomorrow. Needless to say I agree in advance to anything you propose about the English edition. With many thanks and kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
