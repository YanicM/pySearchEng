  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: My wife asks me to say she cashed your cheque and thanks you. A few days ago a letter came for you from Lucia. I can’t find it. Anyhow it was nothing much. However if you care to send her a few lines, perhaps about her book et la pluie et le beau temps and seeing her again in Z’ch when she is better as you hear she is making progress I shall forward it. Look out for the next issue of Transition I have something in it and it is chiefly or in great part about—Gideon. (Book of Judges, chap 6, verse 36 et seq.) Kind greetings to you both. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
