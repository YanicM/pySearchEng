  "text": "Dear Curran: I hope you have had and are having a pleasant vacation, though, if I am to judge by last and this year, you seem to have a singular taste in the matter of localities. If there should be a Japanese-United States conflict next year I wonder to what isle in the water for rest you will fly. I sat for your friend, though at the first sitting I was rather upset on account of something which went against my breath at lunch. I was very glad to receive him both on account of you and of his name. Of course he was nonplussed and humiliated, like all the other painters, when he saw what he had to explain away, trying to find out where the catch was. A part ça, il est très sympathique and sends [?] me the enclosed letter from Dublin. It is very kind of him (and of the other friendly conspirator who I take it, is Mr Curran) but, as I try to recall our conversation at Fouquet’s I begin to think that my command of the president’s English cannot be all that some good people are reported to affirm. O my goodness, what a long peninsular address you have! And today also is the anniversary of the half-time peace of Campo Formio. Anyhow, I will send this letter express and hope it doesn’t follow you around if you are shaughrauning like another of your name. Non troppa patria, Sant’ Antonio!",
