  "text": "Dear Antheil: Many thanks for your fine setting of my verses for the book. Hughes likes it very much. There are just two small points which are not clear to me. Why have you put such a strong musical stress on the preposition in the phrase ‘Arches on soaring arches’ this gives the idea that for the Almighty the construction of the Heaven was a work of great difficulty. Also why a similar stress on the definite article in the phrase ‘From the adoring waste of souls’? When the definite article is stressed like this it sounds like the second personal pronoun in the objective case, or a superlative form of the article. But I did not mean the waste of souls (i.e. the one which won the gold medal) and still less an address to the Almighty ‘From THEE adoring waste’. How are you getting on with the Anna Livia symphony, and how long are you to be down there? If you are there on the 20th of October you should go to Marseilles to hear Sullivan in La Juive. Now as regards Cain, I agree with you with regard to Byron’s drama so far as the second act goes. This could not be sung and I think you would have to do some kind of a figured intermezzo. But the first and third acts cut a great deal seem to me to be capable of great stage effect. As I hear it you would need a second tenor for Abel, a baritone for Lucifer and a base [sic] for Adam. But I do not know what kind of a voice you imagine the Angel of the Lord could have. Perhaps you could borrow the loudspeaker they have in Rouen station. If you feel attracted to the subject could you not start on some of the themes, the opening sacrifice, the fire and whirlwind, Eve’s malediction, the music around Enoch and Cain’s exit? I may be wrong but I think that with such an interpreter as Sullivan would be and with the power you have to your elbow it ought to create an immense effect. I am sending a copy of the play to Sullivan to read. Beecham heard him the other night and told me he had the most amazing tenor voice he ever heard. But at the present turn of his career which I think is favourable it is of vital necessity that he should create a new and striking part. Possibly I am meddling in other men’s matters, a singer’s and a musician’s, but sometimes the words of a fool can be twisted into wisdom.",
