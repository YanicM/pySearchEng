(Also forgot to say that D-J Reddin arrived here as envoy of the Irish Pen Club. I, having been selected by the French Committee, as one of the five guests of honour had the additional honour of receiving him at my table—by no means for the first time, may I add very dryly! He mentioned my sister who, he says, is crazy.) I see one of your neighbours Mr Lennon has also reached the bench. Another to whom I had the honour of being host and to whom I presented at his request, a signed copy of Ulysses after which, in an article in the Catholic World U.S.A. he informed the Teagues that I had acquired my ‘abundant means’ by selling to the British authorities in Rome during the war everything I knew about the Austria which had released me on parole. (I was in Switzerland during the war and for 4 years in a lawsuit against the British Consulate in Zurich, a suit I won) So much for Ireland’s hearts and hands. But most of all what I also want are the following numbers of the Weekly Irish Times.",
