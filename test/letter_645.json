  "text": "Dear Mr Quinn: I understand that the typescript of Ulysses is on its way back, as I instructed. The publication of Ulysses (complete) was arranged here in a couple of days. You will receive a prospectus in a week or so. It appears in October. I hope you received the MS of Circe and Eumeus. As a curiosity I threw in also the 8th draft of the former. Unfortunately, a bad thing has happened. The husband of one of my many typists (an employee of the British Embassy here, named Harrison) found some of the MS on her table, read it, tore it up and burnt it. Hysterical scenes followed, I believe, in the house and in the street. What I am concerned with is that there is now a lacuna of several pages in the typescript, which has already gone to the printer, and I must write it in. Unfortunately, I had sent you the MS a few days before (the MS burnt was a copy of my MS made by Miss Beach). I need about six or seven pages back again for a day or so and will return them registered. Mrs S.W. Beach sails for Europe on 4 May and could bring them. May I ask you to lend them to me? Here is the nearest clue I can give you to the passage: It begins about p. 60 or so, where Bloom leaves the brothel; there is a scene on the steps and then a hue and cry in the street and the beginning of the quarrel with the soldiers. Six or seven pages after Bloom’s exit (which you will find at a glance by the long catalogue of the persons in pursuit) will suffice. In great haste and with regards and best thanks for your advocacy, Sincerely yours James Joyce",
