  "text": "Dear Miss Beach: I return you herewith posthaste the pomes in their proper order with correct dates and text and an addition to face p. 2 and if you fill in the titlepage it is all right but I should like to check a final proof in bound proof. Has my brother not sent on the rest of the MSS yet? I am sorry I could not hear you. There is a station (on 1950) at Scheveningen but it runs in the season only for transmitting. There is scarcely a soul there on account of the cold spell so we stay in the town and tram it out: it is only about 10 minutes. Here it is very quiet and dear but the people are very civil and obliging and not rapacious really. It is the exchange and the small things do not hit them at all though to us they seem terribly dear. The strand is wild and endless. Unfortunately I had a dreadful time with a savage dog on Wednesday 25 inst. My wife and Lucia had gone for tea and I walked on a mile or so and lay down on my overcoat reading the baedeker and trying to make out the coastline when the brute rushed from Lord knows where at me. I beat him off a few times. His owner ran up and his mistress and they got him down but he slunk round when their back was turned and attacked me again in the same way fully four times. It lasted I am sure a quarter of an hour. In my alarm my glasses got knocked and one of the lenses flew away in the sand. When Madame or whatever she was finally tugged the animal away howling the owner and I went down on our knees and after groping for a long time found the lenses. I feel so helpless with those detestable animals. Revolver? I suppose he would have me before I made up my mind to fire. Or carry stones in my pocket? If I could do the trick of gentleman into fox I could save my breath better. Thank Mrs Antheil for the words. I shall use some of them. As regards the rest I will explain to her in Paris. I hope Ulysses IX will soon ascend the papal throne. His motto is to be: Triste canis vulpibus = This â€™ere dog will worry them there foxyboys. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
