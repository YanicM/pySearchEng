  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver This is the most I can do so please forgive the style of paper and pen. My lease of this flat was up on the 15 instant but as there seemed no prospect of getting away I asked to have it renewed for two months. An X ray examination is to be made first to see whether any of the old abscesses have reformed and if so it is to be removed before the other operation (capsulotomy) is done. He is positive that I will have good sight. I cannot see a word of print yet. It is very boring. Mr Eliot wrote to say that April no had gone to press. Mr Auguste Morel helps me and with him, some red ink and a magnifying glass I shall have the piece ready before the tooth and eye act starts. I enclose programme of Exiles and a few notices. Mr Boyd has a reply to Mr Larbaud in the N.R.F. Miss Beach would like to have the programme afterwards. The weather keeps bad here, it is against me. The only touch of the south is a young cat, biscuit-coloured, I have from Marseille. He is deeply bored by the Paris murk but eats a lot of bread and butter and the Daily Mail. Not knowing what to do I make vocalizzi at the piano and octogenarian’s exercises with an elastic stretcher I found in my son’s room. I wanted to send you a new book by Mr Pound, a large paper edition of the kind you do not like much but will wait till I can write better. I wish I could do more but it is useless to think until these new troubles are over, but I will send you the Criterion piece (new version) as soon as I can. I hope the snow and gales do not roam around you as they do through the Eiffel tower here. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
