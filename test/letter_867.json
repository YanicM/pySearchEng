  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have been working very laboriously these last few weeks and have almost made a first draft of Yd. My cold has gone. Mr Walsh has been moving from Como, via Milan, via Genoa and Rapallo, via Mentone and now Grasse with my proofs and typescript and letters and Miss Beach’s following him while he sends explosive letters full of what she calls ‘guesswords’ etc. Goodness knows what sort of text of mine he will offer to his readers if ever the second number comes out. Nobody here, not even Mr Ford, can solve the problem of Two Worlds. Huge advertisements have appeared in several big American and English reviews, the former costing, I am told, $1000 each! I never wrote a letter or sent any MS to Mr Roth. He wrote (or roth) to me in 1921. I did not answer, I think. He also wrote to me on 25 September asking me to give him something and said he would buy the forests of Hudson Bay for paper etc. I did not answer. And yet number 1 apparently came out on 15 with a piece of mine in it. I have sent two cables to New York but have got no information yet. An American journalist told me that to cover the expense of such ‘billing’ there ought to be a circulation of hundreds of thousands of copies and the actual number is 450! I am having queer experiences with editors. New press opinions of U are: ‘all Greek to us’ ‘unfortunately I can’t read it’ ‘is it a puzzle?’ ‘has anybody had the courage to ask J. how many misprints are in it’ ‘those French printers!’ ‘how is your eyesight?’ ‘charming!’—This last from Mrs Nutting, who, however, heard me read it and indeed suggested my voice should be dished (misprint for ‘disced’). Mr Antheil has received a copy of musical supplement to This Quarter with some pages of his Cyclops setting. He has not shown it to me as yet. I believe Mr Pound got it published for him. I shall go to see Dr Borsch (of whom I dreamed last night) tomorrow for the first time since I was ill and ask him to let me finish Yd before the next match. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
