  "text": "Dear Mr Pugh: I am here on holiday away from books of reference so am trusting to memory as regards your address. In the first place I hope you are well and that when you next visit Paris you will come to see me. My address there is now: 7 rue Edouard Valentin, Paris VIIe (Tel: Invalides 50.38), My American publisher would like to have for a circular he publishes some photographs of scenes mentioned in Ulysses so I wonder if you would consent to have some of yours reproduced. I remember Kiernan’s but he would also like to have the Martello Tower (Sandycove), Holies Street Hospital and the view of the Strand at Sandymount showing the Star of the Sea Church. Of course he would use your name and I take it these things are paid for. There is still another matter in which you could aid me. Apart from the usual U.S. edition there is to be brought out before Christmas an édition de luxe with a preface by some writer and a series of 30 illustrations by the French painter Henri Matisse. He is at present in the south of France doing them. He knows the French translation very well but has never been in Ireland. I suppose he will do only the human figures but even for that he would perhaps need some guidance. Do you know any illustrated weekly published in Dublin about 1904 or before that time? If I could have some back numbers (the picture pages only) to show him when I go back to Paris he might be able to conjure up the past better. If you can find any back papers please let me know what they cost and I shall remit you the amount. With many thanks in advance sincerely yours James Joyce",
