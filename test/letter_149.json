  "text": "Dear Stannie I received yr. letter with enclosures. It is well you told me who the silhouette was for I’m damned if I would have known otherwise. It has the very artistic (I believe) merit of not resembling the original. Of Gogarty’s card I can make nothing. I don’t understand why he desires that we should exchange short notes at long distances and at different angles to the equator. What does he mean by ‘acquiring the villa villa for the natives’? Why does he expect I am going back to my, to my land? What news does he want and what is the ‘valuable’ news he has? The underlining of ‘Mr’ beneath the portrait of that handsome person, Paul Verlaine, caused a smile to appear upon the face of the dutiful employee of Messrs Nast Kolb and Schumacher but he became serious when he perceived that the card came from ‘S James’s Hotel; Paris’. By the way, talking of faces I will send you a picture postcard of Guglielmo Ferrero and you will admit that there is some hope for me. You would think he was a terrified Y.M.C.A. man with an inaudible voice. He wears spectacles, is delicate-looking and, altogether, is the type you would expect to find in some quiet nook in the Coffee-Palace nibbling a bun hastily and apologetically between the hours of half-past twelve and one. I am changed in the bank from the correspondence to the reception room. It is a good thing the salaam has gone out of fashion here. I am with the banker’s two sons and another man. Have a desk and lamp all to my own self and not at all so much to do. I have to receive visitors who come with letters of credit cheques &c. Today I had the honour of cashing a cheque for 8 guineas issued by the Freeman of Dublin and handing 200 and odd lire to their Roman correspondent, one Mr P.J. Connellan, if you remember reading any of his articles concerning our holy father the pope and the blessed virgin mary and jesus christ and god almighty and the holy ghost and saint joseph. (Excuse this experiment. I wanted to see who would look funniest. I think saint joseph wins with jesus christ a good second) I can see the papers here too, that is, some of them. Daily Mail and Figaro. On the whole it is a change for the better and it looks as if they intended to keep me. I have waited another day and there is no letter from you or paper from Dublin. As I told you I have a lesson every evening and the money my pupil gave me will carry me on till the 20th, I think. I asked him if he could find me another pupil as there are unfortunately 30 days in this month. I will ask him again tonight. After the 1st of Oct I think we shall eat in the house as the weather will be getting too cool for Georgie to go out. Rome certainly is not cheap. A lira goes a very short way indeed here. Wyndham ought to be back from Naples in a day or so and I ought to have an answer from Grant Richards in the morning. The mention of his name brings back to me my early youth. On Saturday last I went up to the headquarters of the black lice to find out if they had chosen their general. A carman told [me] they had elected a German and were now at their pranzo. Unfortunately I have not bought the Avanti these few nights. I would like to read an article on the subject. The Very Rev. Fr. Devitt S.J. came to Rome—to help in the kitchen I suppose. The next thing we will hear will be the emperor William’s enrolment in the brown scapular. There was a thunderstorm here yesterday evening and seeing my agitation the banker’s son was kind enough to close the shutters. A man was struck dead on the road outside the gate of S. Paneras. About Georgie I was in the bank at the time and Nora could do nothing. There was a notice on the wall ‘Drive Slowly’ but no policeman of course. The next day I saw one of these glorious creatures cross-examining a poor little old woman, driver of a little ass-cart because she hadn’t her name on the shaft. He wrote a terrible lot in a little notebook and the little woman smiled timidly all over her shrivelled face and still the pencil went on and the red cock’s comb in the policeman’s hat bobbed. Here they dress carabinieri like stage flunkeys. They must look esthetic when they run after a mad horse. The weal has disappeared. I think it would be safer for you to send me some money on Saturday. I will send you L50.0.0 on the 1st October: that will leave me 200 Lire. I must pay 45 to the landlady and 10 for trousers so that I will have about L140 left for the month. Every month I will send you at least L50, if the eating-at-home plan succeeds, perhaps L70. You can add, I expect, the difference between that and 100, so that we may always have something to fall back on. I read an article lately about Gissing. The writer denied the stories of abject poverty. Gissing, after his first book, had always enough to live on, he said. I read an allusion in The Tribune which gave me some anxiety. It spoke of a series the ‘X’ series of booklets the publication of which was ‘begun by the late firm of Grant Richards’. Now does late refer to the firm of Grant Richards, bankrupt, or to that of E. Grant Richards? Explain to Scholz that I live two miles from the Berlitz School, that I go to the office at 8½ in the morning and get out at 8 in the evening with an hour for lunch and that I have an English lesson every evening from 8.30 to 9.30: so that it is out of my power at present to go there and interview the director on his behalf. Is there any news of Bertelli? Did you approach Canarutto again. Do so, if only to annoy him. Pay no bills whatsoever of mine. If you have not signed any documents they cannot make you. Say you paid me 22 lire a week for your board and lodgings. But I think you can be trusted not to be swindled out of money. [Unsigned]",
