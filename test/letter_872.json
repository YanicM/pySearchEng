  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am not going into the clinic this morning. For the last week Dr Borsch has been treating the other eye with scopolamine for what he calls a suffusion and he will not operate till both are normal. The ‘scopo’ obstructs my sight in reading and I cannot finish Yd before Wednesday. I must do this before I go in if I am to have any peace…. My wife does not seem to like the idea of this operation but the nurse says that when Dr Borsch has made an operation which he considers final he tells the patient ‘La nature fera le reste’ and does not encourage the patient to try again. It is a dreadful bore especially now that my slow brain has got to work well after two months’ labour. But I will rest for a couple of days and probably jump through hoop no 7 on Friday or Saturday. Here is a cutting of Mr Mulligan and there is Lalou’s article in Vient de Paraître and an article about U in the New Republic by Edmund Wilson. You must be having a bad time with all those troubles. I hope they are past and that your health is good. Your MS this time will be partly written by Lucia (who calls it ‘cinese’ (Chinese). I mean the penscript not the pencil draft. It will be finished tomorrow surely—of course only as a first draft but I perceive that I have written more of the book than I had thought. I am sending you the papers. Can you return them to Miss Beach for her files? I hope this house is worth all the outlay or even that my writing of late is? With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
