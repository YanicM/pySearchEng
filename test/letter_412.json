  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I confirm my letter of 31 ult with enclosed signed agreement. Mr Pound writes that the American quarterly review Drama has in the February number an article by him on my play. He suggests that the play be now offered to the review. Can you get into relations with the London agent or deal direct with the review? The address is: ‘Drama’, 736 Marquette Buildings, Chicago, U.S.A. I hope that you will soon succeed in doing something with the play or the verses as now that the nine months’ grant made me in August by the Royal Literary Fund has expired, my position here is likely to be very uncomfortable. If any royalty be due to me on Dubliners I shall be glad to receive it. It might also be possible to arrange for an American edition of that book. Mr Huebsch of New York wrote to me on the matter last summer. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
