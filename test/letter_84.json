I shall be glad if you will send me back the manuscript of my verses if there is no longer a possibility of your printing them. I hope you will excuse me for troubling you about such a matter but I want to try to have my verses published this autumn. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce P.S. The MS ‘Chamber Music’ was given to you by Mr Symons in September last.",
