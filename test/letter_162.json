  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards, As the publication of the verses of which you have had my MS for more than two years would, according to your latest proposals, be practically indefinitely postponed, I have decided to accept a proposal which Mr Arthur Symons has made me with regard to their publication and therefore ask you kindly to send me back by return of post the MS of the verses. Now as to Dubliners as to which in your letter of 24 Sept. you say you are waiting to hear from me. On first reading this letter I took it for a refusal to consider any further the publication of my volume of stories although I had gone so far and given myself so much trouble in order to meet all your objections, little as I agreed with them. I could not believe, however, that this could be the case in view of our agreement and your own letters to me on the subject so I have taken some time to go through them again very carefully and to reconsider my position thoroughly in this matter so that I might, if possible, bring you without any further delay or hesitation, to carry out loyally your undertaking and finally bring to the light of day the stories of which you have been so kind as to express a high opinion more than once. Without prejudice, therefore, to any of my indisputable rights I still think that this desirable end may be attained on the lines of your letters of 16 May and 14 June last: namely: 1. omission of the word ‘bloody’ in the stories: a) Grace b) The Two Gallants c) Ivy Day in the Committee-Room 2. retention of the word ‘bloody’ in: a) The Boarding-House 3. deletion of paragraph and substitution of another passage in a) Counterparts. 4. Inclusion, of course, of the last story of which there has been no question: a) A Little Cloud. So far I am, most reluctantly, prepared to go but no further. Finally, one word as to my novel. I am not in a fit state of mind to complete it. For two years I have been living in hope and now that I see that these two years of waiting and hoping have availed me nothing it is really too much to expect that I should put my two completed books on one side and continue to write the third: and then to wait and hope again. For I am sure we should have the same objections and the same letters. It is true that I stand in need of a publisher, but the publisher I need must at least be prepared to risk something for what he esteems highly and in the meantime I am glad that my position, modest though it be, enables me to save my work from mutilation and my talent from corruption. I trust, however, that you may yet be able to publish the book of stories in view of the facts I have stated in this letter and, in any case, I will ask [you] to send me the MS of the verses. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
