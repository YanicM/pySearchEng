  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: …. The tumult and the shoutings still go on but I expect that in ten days the captains and the kings will depart. I hope you got the Navire d’Argent and are pleased with my retort courteous. I enclose a letter from the Calendar which Miss Beach would like to have back—also an advance notice by a French critic to appear in Vient de Paraître (sic) in November. I sent you the Chicago Tribune. There have been other allusions since, all at the same time. There is a very curious atmosphere about here since I came back. When I have satisfied myself as to its causes (three of which I suspect) I shall write more. There is a rumour here … that Mr Walsh is in very bad health…. It is impossible to get a reply from him and I have no notion where the MS of Z is at present. I should like to have this settled before I enter the waste land. Which things being so, I began Yd (otherwise the last watch of Shaun) a few days ago and have produced about three foolscapes of hammer and tongs stratification lit up by a fervent prayer to the divinity which shapes our roads in favour of my ponderous protagonist and his minuscule consort. Shall I send you the corrected typescript of U there or wait till you return? I composed some wondrous devices for Yd during the night and wrote them out in the dark very carefully only to discover that I had made a mosaic on top of other notes so I am now going to bring my astronomical telescope into play.",
