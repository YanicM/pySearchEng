  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have been sleeping sixteen hours a day for the past three weeks incapable of thinking, writing, reading or speaking. Here however is a further instalment of news. The second French edition which has been largely subscribed comes out on Xmas Eve. There is a great demand for it in Italy. One of Gilbert chapters, Aeolus, is to appear in an Italian review. The second German edition is also largely subscribed and is to appear on the first of January, and one of Gilbert essays is to appear in a German review and one is to appear in a Paris review and he has been reading to me other episodes. The whole book is to be in London in a few weeks. Fargue has written an article about me and is coming here tomorrow when he and I are to set to work to put Alp into French, the last eight pages. Ogden sent me a disc but Lucia broke it and we are waiting for the others. One will be sent to you as soon as that H.M.V. factory wakes up. Herbert Hughes the musician was here. He took down from me at the piano my two Irish come-all-yous and is going to set them and publish them as sung by. He also told me that he would arrange to have five of the songs in P.P. set by five English composers including himself (he is from Belfast) and published in one volume. The others are to be by Arthur Bliss, Arnold Bax, and I think he said Vaughan Williams. Eugene Goossens also wrote for leave to set eight more of Chamber Music. Nineteen of this book alone were set this year so the title appears to have been justified. My son sang at a semi-private concert a couple of weeks ago and had a big success. I brought the leading tenor of the Paris Opera there, Mr John Sullivan, probably the most powerful dramatic tenor at present alive and a great admirer of mine. He liked him well and is going to push him as much as he can. Lucia … hopes that if Margaret Morris comes to Paris, as she is announced to do, she may get a position as instructor at the school. She has plenty of voice too, possibly more than her brother, but she refuses to sing. I shall begin now to howl every afternoon in the hope of wakening myself and not having anything better to do. Did I tell you A.M. is married. He is translating into French Lady Chatterly’s Lover and is to do the rest of P.P. I cannot get any satisfactory reply from anyone in London about Dujardin’s book and the poor man thinks it is all settled, G.M.’s preface and everything. You remember his dedication in Les Lauriers. Well he brought me his Ulysses and to give him cake for bread I wrote in it ‘To E.D. Annonciateur de la parole intérieure, le larron impénitent. J.J.’ Our girl Laure got married but we’ve got another one after a great deal of difficulty in this festive season or advent thereto. I may have some further news concerning my sight in a week or so as Drs Collinson and Fontaine are going to have a consultation. They are all as much in the dark as I am. James Stephens was over here for a week. I saw him nearly every day and explained to him all about the book, at least a great deal, and he promised me that if I found it was madness to continue, in my condition, and saw no other way out, that he would devote himself heart and soul to the completion of it, that is the second part and the epilogue or fourth. I was very glad to speak with him and we will leave it at that for the moment. I am now no longer bound down to Transition but I have the Earwicker fragment still hovering over me. Where I am to get the energy within me or the manifold assistance outside me to cope with this fragment for private publication at present I don’t know. I hope you like Transition and the use I have made of your book on the City churches. I have had a letter from Schwartz asking me to send him a photograph as he feels so lonely in London. There is a long article in the December Vanity Fair about T.H. Speaking of T.H. reminds me of the death of T.P. The rapprochement between myself and very old men is very curious. E.D., Italo Svevo, G.M., and even T.H. himself. And now the poet-laureate Robert Bridges of his own initiative has sent me a signed copy of his last book The Testament of Beauty, dedicated to the King, with an inscription expressing his full sympathy with what I am trying to do. Imagine my astonishment. The coalminers have also written again offering to put us up for a fortnight etc. I hope you are escaping the wild weather up your part, and that when you have time you will write to me sending me your own news. Having said which he laid his head on the table and lapsed into the arms of Murphy.",
