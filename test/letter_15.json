  "text": "Dear Stannie, I send you two poems. The first one is for the second part and I fancy it will pique Eglinton’s curiosity. By the way I wrote nothing in my review of Everyman’s book (damn Everyman anyhow!) about the printing and binding. My little editor must have added that but I wrote about the people ‘who are beginning to talk a little vaguely about their friends the French’ which is pretty well—Was that in it?—I am feeling very intellectual these times and up to my eyes in Aristotle’s Psychology. If the editor of the ‘Speaker’ puts in my review of ‘Catilina’ you will see some of the fruits thereof. Words cannot measure my contempt for AE at present (I believe he didn’t write to Lady Gregory) and his spiritual friends. I did well however to leave my MSS with him for I had a motive. However I shall take them back as my latest additions to ‘Epiphany’ might not be to his liking. And so help me devil I will write only the things that approve themselves to me and I will write them the best way I can. It is the same way with boots. O, I have revelled in ties, coats, boots, hats since I came here—all imaginary! So damn Russell, damn Yeats, damn Skeffington, damn Darlington, damn editors, damn free-thinkers, damn vegetable verse and double damn vegetable philosophy! Jim I hear an army charging upon the land And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees, Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand, Disdaining the reins, with fluttering whips, the charioteers. They cry amid the night their battle-name; I moan in sleep, hearing afar their whirling laughter. They ride through the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame, With hoofs clanging upon the heart, as upon an anvil. They come triumphantly shaking their long green hair, They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore— My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair? Little white breast, O why have you left me alone? When the shy star goes forth in heaven, All maidenly, disconsolate, Hear you amid the drowsy even, One who is singing by your gate. His song is softer than the dew And he is come to visit you. O bend no more in revery When he at eventide is calling, Nor muse who may this singer be Whose song about my heart is falling? Know you by this, the lover’s chant, ’Tis I that am your visitant. JAJ Paris, 1903",
