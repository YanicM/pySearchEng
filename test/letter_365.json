  "text": "Dear Sir Mr Richards has written me, enclosing a statement of sales for the first six months. It seems that 379 copies of Dubliners have been sold in the United Kingdom. I bought 120 copies. He says that he has received a letter from you and I have informed him that you are empowered to transact all business for me as I live too far away to be able to do it myself. The fifth chapter of my novel must in any case be returned to The Egoist not later than the 20 May as it is needed for the June issue. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
