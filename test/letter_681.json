  "text": "Dear Larbaud: Here is my copy of the book so far for you to look through to refresh your memory. I should like to have it back as soon as possible—even piecemeal—as I need it to refer to. One copy of each page proof coming in will also be sent you. I add the unrevised pages (galley) of the Messianic scene from Circe. Can you fix Wednesday 23 Nov. as date of conference? The translations of passages chosen by you have been made. I went over them with Benoit-Mechin. Kind regards James Joyce",
