  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker I thank the lady who represents the American Syndicate for her good opinion of my play and am sorry she has refused it as unfit for her theatre. I do not know anyone to whom you could submit it. Mr Pound or this lady herself might be able to direct you. The former wrote of Mr Cecil Dorrian but I suppose this gentleman is another member of the same syndicate. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
