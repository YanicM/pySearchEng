  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: My wife has just been examined by the three doctors and her case pronounced a complete success—one of the quickest and most satisfactory on record…. I am hopelessly overworked and my sight has got rapidly worse. Borsch told me last night that if it did not improve in a week or so that both eyes should be operated. I have not told my wife yet. I am to be seen by some other doctors first. I am very hesitent about these operations and no wonder. Enclosed are notices for U. I can scarcely see this scrawl but I hope you can read it. I need another week’s sight to finish Yc. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
