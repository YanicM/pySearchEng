Have written to Lidwell who is now acting for me. Am preparing a draft for him of the whole story. Meanwhile have written to Roberts, saying I can take no step without advice from my solicitor and that if he can lay before us any proposal from G. Richards or another publisher we will consider it and that the affair must be ended. Picciola. Am waiting reply from this pigskin. Ralli. Will you take on his lesson? He is due in Trieste from manoeuvres on 17th inst and has to finish this month. You can write him Casa Ralli or â€™phone him c/o Hacker and Meissner, Punto Franco (1142. tel. no). He will continue next year and has paid this half month coming. A very agreeable fellow. Jim",
