  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: In case there is a hitch in the negotiations between Drs Forel and Loy, to whom I am trying with Forel’s full approval to transfer her, I must have some reserve. Here is a wire of advice from my friend Léon. Can you get me the correct name and address of this doctor who is evidently a psychiatre I received a long and very friendly letter from Mrs Fleiner giving me the name of the Z’ch doctor who is an authority on blood diseases. It is Prof Näggeli. But this of course is the purely physical side. I was advised at Nyon not to speak of the Davos suggestion for some time yet Thanks anyhow sincerely yours James Joyce",
