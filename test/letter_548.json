  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks indeed for your kind thought of sending me your photographs at Christmas. I am very glad to have them. I am sorry however that my silly verses caused you some moments of depression. They are not worth so much. I wonder then what kind of impression my tiresome interminable unexhil⁠[ar]⁠ating book Ulysses makes on you! I notice that the snapshot you sent is from Saint Ives. May I ask if you come from there? I have heard very much about it from a friend of mine, a painter. I have been inquiring about the best way to send the MS as the postal service in this annexed zone is not very good. I think my brother-in-law (who is cashier of the CzecoSlovak bank here) can arrange to have it sent with their mail in four different sendings. If this cannot be done I shall send it (also in four lots) by post. Of course if all or any of it goes astray I shall write it out again for you but it would be better for you to have the original. The ‘original’ original I tore up and threw in to the stove about eight years ago in a fit of rage on account of the trouble over Dubliners. The charred remains of the MS were rescued by a family fire brigade and tied up in an old sheet where they remained for some months. I then sorted them out and pieced them together as best I could and the present MS is the result. The copies of the novel sent to Messrs Bemporad have arrived but those for Messrs Schimpff have not yet come. I fancy that many could be sold here but perhaps the exchange, so unfavourable to Italian buyers, will be an obstacle. Unfortunately I have not yet found a flat and have not as much quiet and freedom as I should like. I am working at the Nausikaa episode. It is very consoling to me that you consider me a writer because every time I sit down with a pen in my hand I have to persuade myself (and others) of the fact. However I hope to finish this episode during January. I ought to return your kindness in sending me your photographs but, except for a few snapshots, I have no photograph of myself made between the year 1904 when I left Ireland and 1915 when I left Austria. I have however another made in Zurich for Mr Huebsch and one taken in Paris but do not wish to inflict them on you unless you would like to have them. I believe the photograph taken in Zurich is good but the others are not. Your photographs are excellent, I think. But when I sent a photograph some years ago to Mr Pound he wrote me a letter in alarm (wellfounded, as it came out afterwards) about the pathological condition of the eyes. I renew my good wishes to you for 1920 and hope to complete my book during the year. With sincerest thanks and regards James Joyce",
