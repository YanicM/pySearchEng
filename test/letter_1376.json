  "text": "We called to see Ponisovsky. His morale seems very good and Léon saw the doctor today who is quite satisfied but will not give his final opinion till after an examination on Thursday. He is very brave and cheerful. A bad fog here. We stay a day or two as I want to rest before seeing Vogt. My sight is much easier (100% better according to Collinson). I had no inflammation or redness just fatigue. Am sending this off in a hurry. Forgot to say Soupault and Curran’s daughter were at my party too and Mlle Suzy, the hatter, sent a message to the maître (i.e. J.J.) saying Ulysse had opened up a new world for her. A.P. sends greetings Tante bellecosea tutti Babbo",
