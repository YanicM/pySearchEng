  "text": "Dear Stannie Got your letter today. M and R arrived here at 5.30 p.m. and are safely installed at present in Finn’s Hotel. Dublin has impressed them very much. I got M to wire Vidacovich to pay you the 32 crowns so that with 20 I sent you can pay one month’s rent at least. I wish Steiner would even acknowledge: it has made a bad impression on the people here. I hope the debts are now a little better. Pappie has conjunctivitis and a slight form of iritis. Tomorrow I shall know whether plans of Mary Street were passed. If you authorise me I will send stuff for overcoating. If Bartoli gives you seven crowns send it and I shall send cocoa. Will send cocoa to Nora at once. Send me by return (registered) my crest. Jim",
