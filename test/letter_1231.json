  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: This being San Nicolò I hope you have given Stevie something in our name. You are too far away to send him anything. Here are some clippings for you. There is a good cavatina or cantabile for bass in the first act of Haendel’s Saul ‘Wie beb’ ich vor Zorn’. Giorgio ought to learn this bass part. It is very dramatic and Saul always is in a deuce of a temper about one thing or another. In fact he never expresses any sentiment except sceptical mistrust and bile. The bass named Tapolet was quite good and the baritone named Book excellent. He sings Samuel. It is stifling Föhn weather and I have an unpleasant attack of tracheitis. We have almost decided to have Lucia’s scar removed here next week. The removal of your things has begun. It is quite a work in progress too. The very greatest, nay the most religious, care will of course be taken of the vacuum cleaner and the icebox. I am in a hurry to catch the boat as usual. Herewith best wishes for your forthcoming marriage anniversary which we shall confirm by cable. Tante belle cose Babbo",
