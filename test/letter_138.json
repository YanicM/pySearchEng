  "text": "Dear Stannie As for the passage we were not sick. Going from Fiume to Ancona we slept all three the night on deck. Georgie held out bravely until he came to within a few miles of Rome: then he began to get restless. The voyage and the knocking about didn’t do him the least harm. Fiume is a clean asphalted town with a very modern go-ahead air. It is, for its size, far finer than Trieste. As for Ancona I cannot think of it without repugnance. There is something Irish in its bleak gaunt beggarly ugliness. The money-changer swindled me out of 2 lire, the cabman out of half a lira, and the railway official out of three lire. But I was in such a hurry that I could not protest. We had to drive about three miles from the pier to the train. Such a panorama of houses! There is nothing special to relate concerning my interview with the bank manager, who by the way, is consul for Austria-Hungary. He wanted to know was my father alive, my age, was Harrington a friend of our family. I am at present in the Italian correspondence department, hours, 8½ to 12 and 2 to 7½. The work is very easy and mechanical. The atmosphere seems to me a little more antipathetic than that of the B.S. There are fifty to sixty employees in the bank. I have seen S. Peter’s, the Pincio, Forum, Colisseum [sic]. The Vatican is closed on Sundays, my only free day. S. Peter’s did not seem to me much bigger than S. Paul’s in London. The dome from inside does not give the same impression of height. S. Peter is buried in the middle of the church. The Pincio is a fine garden overlooking one gate of the city. I expected to hear great music at the mass in S. Peter’s but it was nothing much. However it was a side-altar high mass. The church has about twenty altars. The neighbourhood of the Colisseum is like an old cemetery with broken columns of temples and slabs. You know the Colisseum from pictures. While we were in the middle of it, looking at it all round gravely from a sense of duty, I heard a voice from London on one of the lowest gallery [sic] say: —The Colisseum— Almost at once two young men in serge suits and straw hats appeared in an embrasure. They leaned on the parapet and then a second voice from the same city clove the calm evening, saying: —Whowail stands the Colisseum Rawhm shall stand When falls the Colisseum Rawhm sh’ll fall And when Rawhm falls the world sh’ll fall— but adding cheerfully: —Kemlong, ’ere’s the way aht— Besides that, a man pestered me to buy 50 postcards. I told him I was not the Kaiser but he plied me with broken Cockney to buy them for half a franc. And moreover, hardly am I inside the building when an alert person approaches and says: —Guide, sir?— Add to this a party of Murrican gorls in charge of an old dame who asserts that she doesn’t believe a word of it. It is a relief not to understand the language sometimes. But enough now of stupid monuments. The first thing I look for in a city is the café. Rome has one café and that one is not as good as any of the best in Trieste. This is a damn bore for me. It has however countless little coffee-bars. I am forced to go to a little Greek restaurant, frequented by Amiel, Thackeray, Byron, Ibsen and Co; bill of fare in English, I½ for a coffee, pot of tea 6 cups 6d, Daily Mail, N.Y. Herald, Journal. So you must read the papers for me as I needn’t say the D.M. and N.Y.H. are empty until Wyndham comes back when I may find something better. You may pay the baker. His bill should be five or six crowns. Send its amt to me if it appears to you excessive. But if not pay him in two instalments. Tell the tailors my address is Edinburgh or Glasgow. You can give my address and compliments to the doctors. You enclose one (not two) postcards: from the daughter. About paying F. rent. Let him speak first. Then you might say: I cannot pay my brother’s debts but I will pay for 1 month’s occupancy of my room at the full rent. Don’t do this, however, before asking time to write to me. Before entering Canarutto’s cousin’s, go to Can. and ask him has the furniture been sold. Explain to him that he promised to sell it for a good price and remind him that I paid him 120 crowns and that it would be unfair to refund me none of it. Give my address and compliments to Scholz and tell him to write me what he wants me to do. Ask him was he paid for the translation. I think 30 crowns was absurd for that work and kindly say so to A when he gives you the proofs to correct. I have now only 100 lire left. However I know the place a little better now. It is a trifle dearer. I think it is better for us to make no move till the two months are over. Then, if you like, I can move you here. Any news from G.R.? Send on whatever letters come from Dublin and date your letters to me. Literally every man in Rome speaks to and laughs at Georgie. They make presents of biscuits, fruit &c. I don’t believe he has cried once. When he goes into an ‘echoy’ place he shouts: in the Colisseum and in S. Peter’s. The landlady is very fond of him: very nice person, as Maria would say. Kindly answer my letters by return of post until we get more settled. Jim",
