  "text": "Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your favour of 9 inst and a/c of sales to date. I am very much surprised at the fewness of the copies sold and think the book could have been pushed more in view of the good notices it got on all sides. From your letter to Mr Reynolds I gather that as far back as September 1908 nos. XXXI and XXIX were secured by him. Mr Molyneux Palmer set nos. I, III, VI, VIII, XVI, XXVIII, XXXI, IX and Mr Reynolds sent me also a setting of XXII and XX. It seems to me therefore that eleven of the songs were set in all. According to an agreement 50% of the monies received by you for such rights should fall to me (see clause 5). I would therefore be glad to hear on what terms you may have disposed of the songs in question. Mr Reynoldsâ€™ ground of complaint is not very clear to me but I am writing him today on the matter.",
