The notice to quit was revoked by him 4 times verbally in the presence of witnesses and on that assurance I left Trieste with my family. Call and tell him so. Whoever tries to eject me from that flat will pass a damn bad quarter of an hour. The new ‘tenant’ is a try-on. As for Picciola I am afraid he is spoiling for something he won’t like when he gets it.
