  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I shall feel greatly obliged if you can have a certain number of copies of statement (enclosed) copied at my expense and forwarded to the following addresses: i) President: Royal Literary Fund ii) Chairman: Incorporated Society of Authors iii) Mr J.C. Squire, editor, ‘New Statesman’ iv) Mr Edward Marsh, Home Office, London v) Mr W.B. Yeats, 18 Woburn Buildings, Euston Rd vi) Mr George Moore, 15 Ebury Street vii) Mr G.B. Shaw? viii) Rt. Hon. Augustine Birrell? ix) Mr H.G. Wells? A Mr Bazile (whose letter I have mislaid) wrote to me from Paris asking permission to translate my book Dubliners into French and to publish it in a series of Cahiers. He now writes that he can get no satisfactory answer from Mr Richards and applies again to me. I have not even a copy of this book which is out of print and, I should say, likely to remain so. I may add that two local booksellers here have written repeatedly to Mr Richards for copies of Exiles for their customers but always in vain. As there seems to be a hope that I may be able to leave this country early in summer I shall take it as a favour if any royalties accruing on my books for the half year 1/i–30/vi be forwarded me as soon as possible after the latter date as that will facilitate me greatly in the tiresome and rather expensive business of removal. Allow me to thank you in advance for your trouble in having the enclosed forwarded as I request. I feel sure you will agree with me that such a case should be brought to the knowledge of men of letters and of literary societies. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
