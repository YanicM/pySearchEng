  "text": "Dear Mr Palmer I have not forgotten you here. I went to the Secretary of the Feis Ceoil, Mr Charles Wilson, 80 Waterloo Road, Dublin and spoke to him about your songs. He says that it is difficult to do anything until music is printed. As I did not know your intentions I said I thought you would perhaps do the whole suite in time. He said, however, that if you thought well of sending him the eight songs you have already done in MS copy, he would do what he could to bring them under the notice of singers and perhaps have them sung at one of the Feis concerts for a beginning. I regret that so far I have been unable to lay hands on the right version of Billy Byrne. As you were kind enough in a former letter to ask me something about my future works you will perhaps be glad to hear that Messrs Maunsel of Dublin have accepted for publication my book of stories Dubliners (of which I fancy I told you) and hope to bring it out next spring. With kind regards James Joyce",
