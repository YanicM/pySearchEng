  "text": "Dear Reyher: Many thanks for your continued interest in my books. The few press copies (18) of Ulysses have all been disposed of. The edition at 150 francs is sold out and Miss Beach would not like to part with any édition de luxe at 350 or 250 on these terms. Moreover, the translation would take nearer 10 years than 1 year. Let the translator begin on The Portrait (English rights belong to The Egoist Press) which is already translated into French, Swedish and Spanish. If you would pass this information on to him and to his firm they can both get to work when they have acquired the rights. I am going away shortly for a holiday but you can always write c/o Miss Beach here. I hope you are enjoying yourself. I rarely see anybody as I am still busy (a chore) helping in sending out copies. With many thanks and regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
