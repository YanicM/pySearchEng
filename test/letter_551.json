Heap c/o Little Review 24 W. Sixteenth Street New York They write, U.S.A. govt, burned whole May issue and threaten to suppress review on account of me. Wrote to Mrs M to know whether she wants MS of Ulysses. No reply! How the hell am I to get it back. When is your photo coming? Or when yourself? Oxen of the Sun now. Whoo! Any good news of your self.
