  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I enclose a cutting which is not true. My small flat is all upside down with ten cases of books and manuscripts, three sacks of newspapers, four trunks, four valises, three hatboxes etc. I expect to leave Paris on Saturday. The dentist has now supplied me with the permanent set…. Till today I found it difficult to eat and talk. As regards the sight it seems to be getting very slowly better. I can now do some reading and have raced through many accumulated books and notes. It will take many months to heal completely, Dr Borsch says.… There is something fantastic in the huge disorder that now surrounds me. I shall be glad to escape from it anywhere for the moment. I feel in much better health however. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
