  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: I left the keys with Mr Bodington. The policies will follow when they arrive. The reason I took these steps is that a single signed 1st edition of U fetched 2700 frs in the Salle Drouot last year, that Schwarz told me 10,000$ was offered for my father’s portrait when it was hung in N.Y. and that Marehand’s picture will also be worth more than you gave for it in all likelihood. I hope all went off well on the 11th. Lucia tells me she had a letter from you about it. Her present address is c/o Miss Eva Joyce, 12 Mountjoy Square, Dublin. But she may go on to Galway for a short stay. I sent the Dupan collection. There is none for voix grave. So I sent the best I could: voix moyenne: I shall not write any more today about the art of song. I enclose a letter from Mr Kastor and another which present a curious contrast. Perhaps in a leisure moment you could look up number 2 and see if there is anything behind it. Souppault called here. He was very pessimistic about things in the U.S. But I think everyone is like that in all lands today. But he was very optimistic about Giorgio which is good to hear. Also he told us the child was flourishing. One other item of news I pass on to you with reserve. He said that Cerf was neglecting Ulysses in favour of Miss G. Stein and that in several of the towns where he lectured his hearers could not get copies of it??? As regards the Beach sale of my MSS I am told the rumour is abroad on both sides of Brendan’s herring pond that she, by generously sacrificing all her rights in my favour, has reduced herself to starvation. Mrs Bailly has gone to London and wanted us to go with her. After her return she goes to Dublin, she wants B. to close up shop, sell his business sell his flat and live in dear old Ireland in the morning. I think that’s all the news I have this day of Our Lord (it is really S. Joseph’s) but hope to have a good budget of news in your next. About your chair, Helen. Every time I enter the refectory I bow to it. Also on leaving the refectory after refection. We are on the best of terms. My cordial salutations to you both not forgetting the Society of Jewses (quip borrowed from W. i. P.) Babbo P.S. Photos just arrived. They are very good. The little boy is very good-looking. Giorgio in the paper has exactly the same pose as I have in Silvestri’s picture. Di nuovo Babbo",
