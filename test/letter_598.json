  "text": "Dear Budgen: Have met Sargent several times and dined. He is hung up here for a week. The stories he tells me of mob manners are almost incredible. Have written some of it into Circe which by the way is a dreadful performance. It gets wilder and worse and more involved but I suppose it will all work out. Thanks for the papers you sent which, though very onesided, are most useful. Tomorrow I send you another 10 frs. I see there is or was a paper by Lord Alfred Douglas Plain English. Can you lay hold of any copies? In fact anything in that line will be useful. I am sorry you do not think your ideas on Circe worth sending. As I told you a catchword is enough to set me off. Moly is a nut to crack. My latest is this. Moly is the gift of Hermes, god of public ways and is the invisible influence (prayer, chance, agility, presence of mind, power of recuperation) which saves in case of accident. This would cover immunity from syphilis (σύ φιλις = swinelove?). Hermes is the god of signposts: i.e. he is, specially for a traveller like Ulysses, the point at which roads parallel merge and roads contrary also. He is an accident of Providence. In this case his plant may be said to have many leaves, indifference due to masturbation, pessimism congenital, a sense of the ridiculous, sudden fastidiousness in some detail, experience. It is the only occasion on which Ulysses is not helped by Minerva but by her male counterpart or inferior. Curious that Sargent should be an authority on animals. His character also, it seems to me, may have been like his namesake in the Nestor episode—the schoolboy—written before I had heard of him. Huebsch my New York publisher is here. They say Ulysses will come out first in a private edition of 1000 copies at 150 frs each. Are you strong on costume? I want to make Circe a costume episode also. Bloom for instance appears in five or six different suits. What a book! I hope you are working well. Got notice to quit this matchbox and am running about looking for a flat. Hell! I must get Circe finished and Eumeus under way before I move anywhere. Mind those Yahoos!",
