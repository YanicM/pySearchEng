Three things are lacking in the piece you have, a rubric for paragraph 2, a marginal insertion on the right of the second last page and a title. I shall attend to all this when we return to Paris in a week or so and then write to you. I have not the text here. I hope this will reach you safely as I have forgotten the number of your house. But no doubt it will sincerely yours James Joyce",
