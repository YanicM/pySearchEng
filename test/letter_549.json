  "text": "Dear Aunt Josephine: I hope you are well and that the operation you spoke of went off successfully. I want that information about the Star of the Sea Church, has it ivy on its seafront, are there trees in Leahyâ€™s terrace at the side or near, if so, what are these steps leading down to the beach? I also want all the information you can give, tittletattle, facts etc about Hollis Street maternity hospital. Two chapters of my book remain unfinished till I have these so I shall feel very grateful if you will sacrifice a few hours of your time for me and write me a long letter with details. My novel is translated into Swedish. The Italian translation of Exiles comes out in April. The American censor burned all the copies of last issue of Little Review on account of instalment of my book Ulysses.",
