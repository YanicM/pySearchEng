  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I left Rouen (where we were drenched for 9 days out of twelve) and stopping a night in Niort; and Bordeaux reached here. Thunderstorms greeted my stay in Niort and Bordeaux. Here the weather is serene and warm. I wanted to go to London, if possible, before going back to Paris but as Exiles will be put on in January or February I decided to come south now (in spite of the heat) and go to London then. The soil here is dry sand and the climate ought to improve me and I am only an hour from Dax where Dr Borsch advised me to go. I hope I can do so for a week or so before I go away. But certainly my sight is curious—even in the good eye. At Fécamp in the ninth row of the stalls I could not see the actors’ faces. The morning after I came here I tried to walk down to the beach but had to come back as my sight was overclouded. It is very trying for one’s nerves. The other part of the news is. My concierge writes (without accents) that he is leaving the house. Envoyer he writes envoillez. Lest I should forget him he enclosed a bill. Mr Gorman, my biographer, has been firing letters and telegrams at me. He wants to come and see me. He is in Victoria Palace Hotel, Paris. Mr Walsh has been holding me up with his delay in printing Shem and now the editor of the Calendar has written for the fourth or fifth time to know if he can announce U (Anna Livia) for October. I think I shall say yes for I want to correct the two pieces at once and get a few minutes of torpor before the next act. I started to read Mr Gillet’s article when my sight was better than it is today. I read about half and was much amused by it and gave it to my son. He gave it back saying it was not at all amusing. So I then read the rest of it which, in fact, is very harsh. I think the explanation is to be found in a letter he wrote Miss Beach explaining the delay in finishing his article, his reason being ‘mais je viens de subir la perte de ma mère’. He makes one or two good points which, however, I could answer. But it does not matter. It will act like the Quarterly [article], savage and tartarly. When are you going to London? Mr Mac Cormack will surely give a concert there and I would like you to hear him. Could someone there look out for you and book a seat for you? My host here is onearmed. Rouen is the rainiest place getting Inside all impermeables, wetting Damp marrow in drenched bones. Midwinter soused us coming over Le Mans Our inn at Niort was the Grape of Burgundy But the winepress of the Lord thundered over that grape of Burgundy And we left it in a hurgundy. (Hurry up, Joyce, it’s time!) I heard mosquitoes swarm in old Bordeaux So many! I had not thought the earth contained so many (Hurry up, Joyce, it’s time) Mr Anthologos, the local gardener, Greycapped, with politeness full of cunning Has made wine these fifty years And told me in his southern French Le petit vin is the surest drink to buy For if ’tis bad Vous ne l’avez pas payé (Hurry up, hurry up, now, now, now!) But we shall have great times, When we return to Clinic, that waste land O Esculapios! (Shan’t we? Shan’t we? Shan’t we?)",
