  "text": "Dear Mr Richards: In July 19141 requested you to send a presentation copy of Dubliners to Mr William Archer. I had a letter from Mr Archer this morning in which he tells me that he is quite sure that he never received it. Can you retrace it from your books? If not I shall send you his address and ask you to send it. Your last letter was forwarded to me from Venice. I regret to see that my book has turned out un fiasco solenne â€¦ Sincerely yours James Joyce",
