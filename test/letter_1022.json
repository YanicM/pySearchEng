  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Herewith the cheque with many thanks. My money was wired to Dover while we were crossing to Calais. Miss B. left Paris and it took a long time to get it back. Paris was a furnace so we left after 4 days but I had time to arrange about the 2nd Czech edition of U. and the first of A.L.P. I hope you got the former and also S’s record through Schwarz. I suppose you saw H.H.’s note in the Daily Telegraph the Monday after we left. I should like 2 copies of it. I managed to get Antheil’s setting of Nightpiece and sent it on to him. All will go well if John does not hold up the plan. Tuohy, who painted my father and me, has just committed suicide in New York. We shall remain here only a few days more. It is a charming spot and we have had 9 days of unbroken sunlight so that my lumbago has almost gone but I hear they had ghastly weather all July and August. Yes, we escaped that Paris thunder storm, thank goodness. I hope you are able to read this. My pen keeps running along on the offchance that you will be able. When in Paris I started a subscription for Sage but as his father has come along with aid that is over which saves me a lot of work. The poor fellow has now pleurisy as well. With apologies for this scrawl and kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. The manager and cashier of the Lord Warden hotel at Dover are great admirers of mine and accompanied us down to the boat. Here it is the same, the manager being one Ramon Joyce, a member of a Portugese-French branch of the family. J.J.",
