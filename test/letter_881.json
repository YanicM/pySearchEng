Can you meet me for a few moments at 7 p.m. next Tuesday, at the corner of Avenue Gabriel? I hope so as I have some work which I would ask you to type if you have any free time. I have written it out very clearly and large. I hope you are in good health and not overworked in your new office. With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
