  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Have received your favour of 17 inst and hope to receive soon the first act of the play. Mr Archer writes me that he leaves London on 19 inst but on his return will ring you up and ask you to let him read the play. He tells me also that he never received the presentation copy of Dubliners which I requested Mr Richards to send him in July 1914.1 am writing to see if it can be retraced. I hope you will place the verses and inquire into that matter of the ‘Smart Set’ stories. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
