  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: You will be disappointed when you open this. It is not new MS but the fair copy of Mamalujo which I forgot to send. I have since worked over the typed copy again and have now definitely abandoned it. I could not do much these last weeks as my wife has been attending the dentist for some unpleasant work—now finished. I have prepared a nice intricate Mah Jongg puzzle for myself and shall start on it on Monday. Mr Quinn was here and wants another 150 pages of printed matter = about 500 pages of MS which he says I did not supply, as he is proposing, I believe, to sell Ulysses. He already has the entire MS and, as you will see by the enclosed, does not know (though I supplied him with the list of names of episodes) that Ithaca and Penelope are the two last episodes. I send you a prospectus of Mr Ford’s (he does not wish his other name to be used) new review. I have declined again to let any of the pieces be printed but have allowed my name to go on the contributors’ list. Mr Bird of Three Mountains Press came to me with a proposal about bringing out at once a third (or fourth) edition of Ulysses to be sold directly here. I sent him to Miss Beach who then said she wanted to do it and said she was waiting for me to suggest it. I did not do so because I was not sure of her attitude and also because I did not know what my proposal might entail for her. Does the British Moslem Society publish any propaganda paper? If so I should like to see a copy. My son will sing next Sunday in a chapel of one of the four masters (S. Luke’s) at the request of the choirmaster who was struck by his voice, it seems, at the Schola Cantorum. I don’t know what he is going to sing. I suppose it will not be the third strophe of the Leinster evangelist. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. I have written in the additions. J.J.",
