  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: We are all here. Lucia and the nurse came over from Vence today. There is a lot of news but I am busy trying to get on alone with W i P for Transition. I will continue in pencil for there is something wrong with this ink. I saw Vogt again on Saturday. He injected I don’t know what and I had to go back in 3 hours. It was a test for tension. The result was favourable and he then said he could wait (bad eye). There was no room in the anterior chamber as it was, he would have to cut through the lens to work. This might produce a traumatic iritis which would probably pass over to good eye and perhaps undo all. He says the capsule will shrink in about 1–1½ years and so leave him some space…. He changed my glasses and insists I am to come back to see him every 3 months during that 1–1½ yr. Yeats and Shaw have written me a very complimentary letter asking me to accept nomination as member of the New Irish Academy of Letters. I am declining. Live abroad, bad sight etc. The Albatross Press (rival of Tauchnitz) has been bombarding me with phone calls, telegrams etc from Germany to Z’ch, Geneva and here. They want to take over Miss Beach’s continental rights whether Cerf wins the U.S. case or not. They would sell at ¼ her price but pay only half as much royalties. Of course the sales would be infinitely more numerous. I have not yet replied. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
