I have consented to omit Encounter, delete and change passage in Ivy Day, change names of public houses in Counterparts (Davy Byrnes to Andy Kehoe’s, Mulligan’s to Quinlan’s, Scotch House to Manx House), change name of pawnbroker Terry Kelly to Mickey Grundy, change name of Sydney Parade in Painful Case to White Church! on condition that book is published before 6 October 1912. Colm was present, asked on looking over proofs if the book was all about public houses, asked me if I could not get it published in London, read Counterparts and said it was a terrible story. He came there to help my case. He will review the book for Irish Times and Nation (of London). In the end Roberts (who left the room twice in a temper) said I was to call again on Thursday and he would tell me what his solicitor said concerning the changes I made. Jim",
