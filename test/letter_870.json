  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: A few weeks ago there appeared in the Nation (London), New Republic (New York), Nation (N.Y.) and other papers a fullpage advertisement of a quarterly Two Worlds (15 September, no 1) published by Mr Samuel Roth, 500 Fifth Avenue, N.Y. editors, Mr Ford, Mr Pound, and Mr Arthur Symons. It announced in no 1 a first instalment of a new book by me and in no 2 a second instalment. Mr Ford says he knows nothing of the review beyond the advertisement. I never gave Mr Roth anything or even wrote to him. I had a letter from him about four years ago which I did not answer. A second letter, dated 25 September last (ten days later than no 1) arrived asking for a contribution, long or short. I did not answer the letters which on the other hand expressed great admiration and made some extravagant suggestion about buying up forests for paper in order to secure a great publicity: I can make nothing of the affair and I believe neither Mr Pound nor Mr Symons know anything of this use of their names. Can you find out something about it? When I disposed of the Spanish rights of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man through your father about eight years ago I received a letter which I cannot find. Does ‘Spanish rights’ mean rights for Spain only or also for the Spanish language (South America)? I ask because a translation is coming out in Madrid…. I am going into hospital for a (seventh) operation on my eye so am notifying you of these few points now as I shall not be able to attend to any correspondence for some time after Thursday next.",
