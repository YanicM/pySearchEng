  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for your letter of 22 instant. I understood that Mr Pound had sent Mr Grant Richards the fifth chapter already set up in proof but it is enough that the whole text is now in his hands. Mr Richards says that he will let me know his decision shortly. In any case the two months should be sufficient for his reader, all the more since the first half of the book was forwarded to him by me last July. I have appointed Mr Pinker my literary agent and, as it may be useful for him to understand in what relations I stand and have stood till now with my publisher, I shall be much obliged if you will send him under wrapper a copy of the issue of The Egoist (15 January 1914) containing Mr Pound article: “A Curious History”…. As regards your kind suggestion of sending me copies of The Egoist to above address I think it is better to wait till you hear from me again. I shall inquire. It would give me great pleasure to receive them and read them but there are many obstacles in the way. On the whole I think it is better to wait until I write again on the subject. I shall do so in a few days. At the same time let me say that I am very much obliged for your kind thought.",
