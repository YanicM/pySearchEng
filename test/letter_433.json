  "text": "Dear Sir (or Madam): Messrs Black, Monro, Saw and Co wrote to me on 22 February that they have been instructed by you to forward me on 1 May, August, September and February cheques for £50, making a total of £200. They add that you are an admirer of my writing and desire to be anonymous. First of all I will ask you to forgive my delay in answering. Since 4 February I have been laid up with a painful and dangerous illness of the eyes (rheumatic iritis). As it is the fifth attack which I have had and was complicated with synechia it was quite impossible for me to write until today. I am deeply touched by your generosity. I scarcely know what to say. It has given me the greatest encouragement and, coming at such a time as the present, relieves my mind of many worries. Allow me to express my sincerest gratitude both for the munificence of your gift and for the delicacy of its giving. I hope that the future may justify in some measure an act so noble and considerate. I should like to make some poor return and am therefore writing to the publishers of my books asking them to send me copies so that I may beg you to accept them from me with a dedication. As soon as I am cured I shall continue to write a novel at which I am working Ulysses. I have written also a play Exiles and if it is published this year I shall send it to you. Once more I ask you to accept my deepest thanks and to believe that I am most gratefully and sincerely yours James Joyce",
