  "text": "Dear Pound: Retinal congestion suddenly developed in my left (the only one really left) eye in consequence of months of day and (literally) allnight work in finishing W i P. and I had to leave Paris and come here to see Prof. Vogt. All writing and reading were stopped but it was only strain and righted itself with a few weeks rest and I am now allowed 2 or 3 hours a day work. So I am writing to Hauptmann by the next post both to explain and to thank him I think I can now also send on your different enclosures to la Dyer? I don’t think I ever worked so hard even at Ulysses. Galeotto è il libro e chi lo scrive. Tante belle cose sincerely yours James Joyce",
