  "text": "Dear Stannie, Received your wire but have not yet cashed it. The official would not accept my documents, wanted a ‘passport’. Finally I got annoyed and said ‘By Jesus, Rossini was right when he took off his hat to the Spaniard, saying “You save me from the shame of being the last in Europe”. [’] The official, astounded at this, invited me to come back and repeat it! The which I declined. How I detest these insolent whores of the bureaucracy [sic]. How do the people permit such arrogance. They are all the same. I must however try to save myself these scenes. I have lost two hours and my dinner. By the way, I presume you have sent me something by post: as this will only carry me to Monday morning. I wish I was not so weak physically sometimes. I have more need of a lictor than Renan. Jim Do not overlook the pith of this card.",
