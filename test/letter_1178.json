  "text": "Dear Mr Sullivan: Have just got your wire thanks, but wait your letter to know whether if you finish in Bordeaux on 24 and sing in Avignon on the 26 you will still be able to fit in this Zurich trip as you kindly offered, afterwards, I mean, though in the present theatrical season and with the trouble you have at home I think it unlikely. Mrs Sullivan rang up and I hope the news she is expecting from Prof Lancet (?) on Friday will be better. Anyhow I am glad to hear of your cachets. The enclosed should cause you to laugh in at least 3½ octaves. La bénédiction des poignards n’est rien à côté de vous. The Minotaure which had my open letter to you in the MS for publication found it too difficult to translate. Good luck sincerely yours James Joyce",
