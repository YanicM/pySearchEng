If any letters are at my publisherâ€™s perhaps you could forward them, also. I shall probably remain in Switzerland till it is possible for me to return to Trieste. A letter to above address will find me in any case. I hope that now that we are in direct communication it will be possible to conclude something. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
