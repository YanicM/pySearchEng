  "text": "Dear Yeats: I was delighted to get your letter and to hear you are now much better. Long may you flourish! Yes, I sent everything either to your Merrion Square address or c/o Abbey Theatre and am very sorry my telegram to you for your 70th birthday never reached you as I, of all people, would not have been wanting on that day. This telegram must have been delivered to somebody. Otherwise the French P.O. would have returned it to me. If Mrs Yeats will unsew the first pages of your Ulysses and send them I shall sign them with great pleasure. I mean when you return to Dublin. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
