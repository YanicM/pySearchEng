  "text": "Dear Both, dear Westwood and dear little Avenue: My wife and I are rather well. We hope you are all very well. We suppose there are many ladies and gentlemen on your beach. There are no ladies and gentlemen at all in this house. Last night we went to see Michel Strogoff at the Chatelet Theatre. As we were too rich to have theatre passes we paid for our stalls. There were a great number of performers on the stage. We applauded very much especially the eight horses. I hope your complexions are progressing as Abyssinian is now the fashionable hue for autumn wear. My wife has bought two very nice new pictures as we are entered for the Ideal Homes Trophy. One is by Mr Budgen and the other by Mynheer Vermeer. One of them is said to be an original but I am not sure which. We had quite a pleasant vacation in Versailles last Friday afternoon. I am very pleased with my lovely new teeth. The other day I was accosted in the street by a Mohammadan man, who said to me: By the moustachios of the poet are you not Mr Morganstunde? Madame Sullivan has just arrived and she has brought with her a very nice picture. It is called S. John the Baptist by Signor Leonardo. We should like it very much if you could send us a still life drawing of Broadway at lunch hour. I think printing is such a nice art. On account of the colours, I mean. The other night we went to the opera and heard Sigurd by Reyer. We liked parts of it on account of some of the notes. Monsieur Sullivan is singing at present in a theatre which has no roof. It is near Toulouse. I think this is the proper sort of theatre for him, don’t you? And after that he is going to Athens. καλι άμέρα, κύριε! καλι άμέρα. κύρια! Τι κανετε? καλα, σας έχαριρστώ! while stands the Comeandseum Greece shall stand! Ah, dear West and Bathwood and dear little Youngbranch, there is nothing like the classics before breakfast! You did not know? Pshaw! It is of the pshiunplest! As: I hate people who throw jugs at each other for breakfast. It is so unnecessary. Good children, who read this in peace and joy, Breathe a prayer, drop a tear for The Crockery Joyce",
