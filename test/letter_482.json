  "text": "Dear Mr Reid: Thank you for your letter of some weeks ago. I am not sure whether you got my letter telling you of my illness and operation for glaucoma. I am here hoping to benefit by the drier air but perhaps I shall return soon to Zurich. I send you some English and American notices of my novel, as usual all very contradictory. My play Exiles is to be published at once and I have asked my publisher (Mr. Grant Richards) to send you a copy of it. I hope you will let me know when you get it. I do not know if anyone will put it on. The Abbey Theatre has declined it. The Stage Society (London) is considering it. Is there any theatre in Belfast to which it would be advisable to submit it? I shall be glad to hear about your next book and beg you to accept my friendly wishes for Christmas and the New Year. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
