  "text": "Dear Lucia: We are having tea here with Miss Shapiro, Mrs Bailly’s niece. We were at Fontainebleau for one day only but I think I shall follow your advice and treat myself to a week’s stay at the seaside, starting perhaps tomorrow week. Mamma and I thank you for your letter and also for the lovely drawing of your hand. You wrote, ‘Here you can see how big my hand is’. You should have said, ‘how small it is’. By chance some days ago I wrote to Zurich for the photograph which the young Salzburger took of your hand. This morning it arrived and I enclose it in this letter. Here it is, your beautiful hand. And so I return hand for hand and tit for tat. Both are on the small table. So that’s that. Hope you approve?",
