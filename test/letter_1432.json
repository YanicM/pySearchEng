  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for copies of Epilogue. If you have finished please return the batch of clippings to Gilbert: 7 rue Jean du Bellay, Ile S. Louis, Paris. And please look through these and return them to Beckett, 6 rue des Favorites, Paris XV as soon as convenient. They are for his friend Alfred Perron who is to talk on F.W. from Paris P.T.T. next week. Also please send on to me any other English clippings you may have in hand. â€¦ If I can find it I shall put into this letter a copy of the last letter I sent Gorman, following up three very long cables I also found it necessary to send. The letter was dictated to P.L. The allusion to Giorgio is he found when in the U.S. that the Irish-American element or catholic Irish element regarded him as the son of a British Government secret agent who had amassed much money during the war and in fact when Ireland was having a war with Britain all to herself. (See the Catholic World whatever date it was). With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
