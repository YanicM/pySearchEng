  "text": "Dear Mr Morley: It was very kind of you to act so promptly. You are right in saying that such work is not for the English market. In fact this pochoir reproduction can be done only in Paris and even here only by two or three firms. Some of the lettrines had to be done over sixteen times. As regards my daughter’s alphabet which is now complete it is in the same style but more mature. The lettrines were designed to stand as initials for Chaucer’s poem in ottava rima, A.B.C, translated from the French of Guillaume de Deguilleville, a poem in praise of the Madonna, beginning ‘Almighty and almerciable queen’. Mr Holroyd Reece of the Albatross Press admires those lettrines very much and he wrote to Messrs Burns and Oates about them. I hope that this firm or perhaps the O.U.P. will decide to print the poem with the initials which however would have to be done over here. Apart from this very elaborate and costly work I think that she is capable of doing things simpler and more utilisable. This was why I presumed on so short an acquaintance and asked you to inspect the book. Neither writer or publisher (Miss Beach) of P.P. is taking any royalty or payment in connection with this edition and 33% of the net profits will go to my daughter. I asked her if she had anything else to show and she gave me the enclosed. I am painfully aware that I am already a burden to your firm on account of my tardiness but if I could secure for her any kind of work (she had a bad nervous breakdown some months ago but has come through it well and is full of desire to express herself in this form of art which she has chosen) it would be an immense relief to me. It would probably enable me to go ahead with my own work and so fulfil my engagements towards your firm. If you yourself are unable to commission her perhaps you can direct me to the proper quarter. I do not know where the British and American papers get their scare headlines about me. I have never given an interview in my life and do not receive journalists. Nor do I understand why they should consider an unread writer as good copy. As you see I can write. Unfortunately I cannot read except with a very strong magnifying glass. I went to Zurich in July and Professor Vogt (probably the greatest eye-doctor in the world) found that my sight had somewhat improved. I have to return to him every three months for a year or a year and a half to be under constant observation. He is afraid to touch the bad eye until the process of amelioration in the other has reached its highest point. As these wretched eyes of mine have already been operated on ten times (unfortunately not by him, except the last time) after about 25 years of recurrent inflamations it is a very delicate case to handle. I am glad to hear you are bringing out another fragment of W. i P. But the first part of this letter is the most important at the moment. I shall be extremely grateful for any help or suggestions which you offer me. Please give my regards to Eliot when you write to him. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
