  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have delayed my reply to your letter because I hoped to have had either a telegram or a letter from your solicitors but, as neither has come and as I am in a state of perplexity, I am writing to you now. You have probably discovered by now that I am a very stupid person—a fact which I should have preferred to conceal. I was misled by certain statements or allusions in the last letter your solicitors sent me as well as by my own misinterpretation of what I mistook for a hint as to the name of my benefactress. If you know in what complete ignorance I live of events and persons in London you will perhaps be inclined to forgive my stupidity. I seldom see a paper or a book and am not in correspondence with anyone there apart from formal letters and (now rather rare) letters from Mr Pound. There is no reason why I should withdraw the phrases to which you allude but there is every reason why I should apply and do apply the contrary epithets to myself. I have felt during these last days of waiting an added sense of perplexity due to the fact that at the moment when I have the very great pleasure of knowing that it is you who have aided and are aiding me so munificently you write me that the last episode sent seems to you to show a weakening or diffusion of some sort. Since the receipt of your letter I have read this chapter again several times. It took me five months to write it and always when I have finished an episode my mind lapses into a state of blank apathy out of which it seems that neither I nor the wretched book will ever more emerge. Mr Pound wrote to me rather hastily in disapproval but I think that his disapproval is based on grounds which are not legitimate and is due chiefly to the varied interests of his admirable and energetic artistic life. Mr Brock also wrote to me begging me to explain to him the method (or methods) of the madness but these methods are so manifold, varying as they do from one hour of the day to another, from one organ of the body to another, from episode to episode, that, much as I appreciate his critical patience I could not attempt to reply. I must ask you to add to the great favours which you have given me also that of long suffering. If the Sirens have been found so unsatisfactory I have little hope that the Cyclops or later the Circe episode will be approved of: and, moreover, it is impossible for me to write these episodes quickly. The elements needed will fuse only after a prolonged existence together. I confess that it is an extremely tiresome book but it is the only book which I am able to write at present. During these last two years when I have received your gifts I have always had the foreboding (now proved false) that each episode of the book as it advanced would alienate gradually the sympathy of the person who was helping me. The word scorching transmitted to me by your solicitors in reply to my tentative inquiry has a peculiar significance for my superstitious mind not so much because of any quality or merit in the writing itself as for the fact that the progress of the book is in fact like the progress of some sandblast. As soon as I mention or include any person in it I hear of his or her death or departure or misfortune: and each successive episode, dealing with some province of artistic culture (rhetoric or music or dialectic), leaves behind it a burnt up field. Since I wrote the Sirens I find it impossible to listen to music of any kind. I have tried to express my gratitude to you but I cannot do so. As you are the person who introduced my book A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man to the ‘notice’ of the public I shall feel very thankful to you if you will accept from me the MS of that book. It is in Trieste and, as soon as circumstances there are more favourable, I shall get it and forward it to you. You have given me most generous and timely help. I wish I could feel myself worthy of it either as a poet or as a human being. All I can do is to thank you. Very sincerely yours James Joyce",
