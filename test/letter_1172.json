  "text": "Dear Budgen: Am back here in the city of S.S. Felix and Regula (=Prosperity and Order). They were martyred on the rivershore opposite the Helmhaus. What Taylor says is right re K. You should see K: he is a numero. Allude to the Baroness (?) S.L. as the Lady of the Lake (she was also Lord of the Isles). She gave me a whole trunk full of stuff which I used largely in Circe. By the way I don’t think you give the reader any idea of the awful stupidity and clumsiness of that English paper. The print, the illustrations etc all so dreadfully suet pudding. However, I got some of the absurdest things in Circe out of it. Several weeks ago I sent 50 francs to Bâle for pamphlets about the Alt-Katholische Kirche to be sent to you in London and also 50 francs to London for a copy of Music and Letters with Count Carducci’s article to be sent to you. If you have not got them I have spent 100 francs for nothing, so send off a line express to Léon, 25 rue Casimir-Perier, Paris, VII…. I can’t read your P.S. I worked out still another book touching Nausikaa. But in this respect so far as you are concerned I have always been a joyce crying in the wilderness. Louis Gillet has written a fine preface to Lucia’s alphabet for Chaucer. He wants a chair in Me to be founded at Geneva where he can be my commentator. If you reflect that his father-in-law is René Doumic, perpetual secretary of the French Academy, director of the most aristocratic-catholic-reactionary review in France, and a man who has the disposal of milliards not millions you will understand why people in Paris gasp at the hold I seem to have got there. As the time is short let me know on a sheet of foolscap what other things you need. Fleiner as he is now rector you ought to work him in. Swiss wine is going to be taxed 25%!!! Let me hear by return.",
