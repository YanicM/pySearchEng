  "text": "Dear Mr Bergan: I hope this finds you hale and hearty and as I cannot easily manage to drink to both our good lucks at this distance perhaps the enclosed may solve the problem. These are such mad times in the world that it is probably the best thing to do. I don’t suppose there is any left now of my father’s friends except you and Mr Devan. If you ever see him please remember me to him. As you will see I have changed my address here and have been busy putting new frames round the portraits of Messieurs my ancestors. These worthy people are seeing quite a lot of Europe and they look at one another in a way that suggests: Where next? I hope you will pass a very merry Christmas and that you will lift your glass to old times, as I shall do. And I wish you also good health and all happiness in the coming year. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
