  "text": "Dear Giorgio: As you know, I never reply to requests such as that in the enclosed letter. And yet this seems to be a case where one might make an exception. I am sending it to you and as he is in the same state perhaps you could get in touch with him or perhaps see him. In which case explain to him that I don’t see well. I am not sure which newspaper cuttings I wanted to send you. But either Mamma or the girl appropriates the Irish Times sometimes [when] I turn my back. And if it is not she, other obstacles prevent me. The new photograph of Mamma will be ready tomorrow and will go off on the next boat. She says that she wants you to find her ‘blooming’. And here you have Miss Joyce Bloom. And if you have any other ‘wishes in bloom’ let me know. How are things going with you now? We hope that the results of the operation are beginning to make themselves felt. Mamma’s uncle is visiting Lucia today at Bray and so I hope to have a reliable report soon. Soupault has forgotten to give us the little photograph of Stevie. I shall drop him a line. I hope Colum’s friend will prove useful to you. Even if many promises are of the Kathleen Mavourneen kind, as they say in Ireland: that is: it may be for years, etc, don’t give up hope. The other evening we initiated the great week at Fouquet’s: ourselves, E.J., M.J., P.L. and L.L. They all begged me to recite something beautiful. I smiled modestly but then began. For a couple of hours there followed a succession of poems by Yeats. Everybody congratulated me on my extraordinary memory, my clear diction and my charming voice. Someone added: What a pity he is such a fool! I am not able to extract a penny from that publisher who published The Mime. And he owes me and Lucia 40,000 francs! Our plans for the summer? I don’t know yet. Perhaps we shall buy two Tam O’Shanters and make believe to be in Edinburgh. I hate the summer, you hate the summer, he hates the summer. I wanted to go to Denmark but with whom? If that tragedy had not happened in the Bailly family, perhaps we should already be in the country of Hamlet. It can’t be helped.",
