  "text": "Dear Lucia: Thanks for your letter. I enclose 2 pounds for you. I suppose you received the other money and the medicine. If my prose is difficult to understand by Jove your handwriting is difficult to decipher. Thus we make a pair. It is good about the milk, the eggs and the fruit and as regards the grey or beige stockings I hope there is at least one shop in Dublin where they can be bought…. I am glad that your stay in the island of saints and sages continues to please you. Why don’t you take out a subscription at the local library? So you enjoyed the ride on a jauntingcar as well. This proves that you are a true daughter of Ireland because it makes other people seasick. It appears that you visited the Kilcroney demesne and then left it. And that is well. Woman is changeable. But altogether it seems to me you are not unhappy. Continue so. Life begins tomorrow, as was said by a certain Guido of Verona, an Italian officer who knew how to read and write. You are wasting your breath always telling me you are stupid. I don’t believe it: and I don’t believe it means to say I do not believe it. I am sending you under separate cover an article on Bray which Mamma has found in a London paper. It seems that fun and games prevail on the Irish shores in spite of the clergy. I suppose that when an archbishop bathes he enters the water clothed in all his sacramental robes including mitre and crook. And thenceforth the water is truly blessed. Foxterriers do as much and perhaps more.",
