  "text": "Dear Mother I have not been ‘home’ since morning so perhaps there is a letter there. I am afraid I must ask you to send me something as I do not know if my article has yet appeared in ‘Speaker’. Today makes my second month . .. I sent in the review of Lady Gregory’s book and shall send the others in a day or two. I thought someone would have sent me some shamrock. However Mr Casey gave me a bit. It is a pity I have no dress suit as he had an invitation to the Irish Ball tonight at the Salle Hoche. I am always on the fringes of things. I try to eat as much as I can, for Synge told me fasting cost him £30 for an operation. Jim",
