  "text": "Dear Yeats I have sent the set of proofs of my unfortunate book Dubliners to a publisher: Martin Seeker, 5 John Street, Adelphi. You would do me a great service if you could intervene in its favour and, I hope, some service also to the literature of our country. As you will easily understand it is very difficult for a person living so far away to push on these matters and my book seems to be pursued by a strange ill-luck. If you can do anything in the matter I am sure you will. Wishing you the compliments of the season Sincerely yours James Joyce",
