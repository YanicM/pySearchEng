If you are not coming to the continent you could send the book by someone else who is unless you have lent it in which case the problem is solved for neither you nor I will ever see it again. Some friend of yours, I suppose, in the Irish Tourist Association has sent me a copy of the official Guide to Dublin in which I am mentioned. Will you please thank him from me for his courtesy. As regards the music section of it while the compilers may be correct, in the French sense, in not claiming Dowland for Dalkey it seems to me Field and Balfe should be mentioned. I see too that our old dean of studies has gone. He was a well meaning peacemaker and I hope he is blessed. sincerely yours James Joyce",
