  "text": "Dear Lucia: Thanks for your letter. It seems that things are not going too badly. I prefer to send you the money (here are 2 pounds) by money order, first because the sending of money in any other way is illegal and any Post Office employee has the right to open the envelope and extract the contents and in the second place because in this way I am assured that the money will reach your hands. In any case please acknowledge its receipt. I have not the faintest idea where Dr Tuohy’s house is. You seem to be interested in Celtic antiquities for this man must be at least ninety years old…. [Sullivan’s] address is 43 or 48 rue Daguerre. Daguerre was the French inventor to make the first photograph which at that time was called daguerrotype. I am sending you the Irish Times which contains an article on Bray. I will get Roberts to send you the medicine in the form you wish from their London branch. Customs are a nuisance in all countries! For many years past I have wanted you to take lessons on the harp. I hope you have already had a reply to your advertisement. Send a letter to the Royal Irish Academy of Music. The news from America continues to be ambiguous, to say no more. I have sent you Mrs Bailly’s address. Do as you think best. She sends long and enthusiastic letters to her husband singing the praises of her native country. And perhaps she is right. Write to me on the back of the leaves of the calendar if you like, but why choose the month of December? Winter comes, I know, and the ice-age. But leave me still the illusion of spring. If your handwriting were as neat and clear as your drawings it would be wonderful. But I have already told you that. For the future I won’t insist on it. Let us know if you need anything, I mean clothing or anything else. The trees you love change their leaves with the passing of the months. I suppose you have also received the American magazine Esquire. Perhaps we shall soon have an English magazine entitled Boss. One should always hope. I am glad that you are better and that the place you have chosen still pleases you. My greetings to your cousins, also to Eileen if you happen to see her.",
