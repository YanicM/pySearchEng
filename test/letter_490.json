I send you a subscription (to The Egoist) for a/c of Mr Simeone Levi, Keltenstrasse 40, Zurich. You should also have received subscriptions from Mrs Olga Veneziani. … I shall try to get you other subscriptions. Could you send me Mr Cournos’ article about my book published in the Apollo of S. Petersburg. I am collecting the continental notices. I hope some French notices will appear. Has Mr Davray written nothing? I hope to send you some other Italian and Dutch reviews. With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
