  "text": "Dear Budgen: I am sorry to hear that Mrs Budgen is, or has been, ill but hope she is all right by now. It so happens that I wanted to write to her as perhaps she can help me with a line or two to some good furrier. All Lucia’s clothes were either lost or stolen or given away in Dublin—two trunks full, including her fur cloak. Now I want to buy for her a new one before the cold November long dreary weather starts. I thought her (L’s) doctor might give leave for her to come for one afternoon to London and choose it with Mrs Budgen but, as that is impossible, a letter to her former principal (?) might do. If also an accommodation as to payment could be arranged, tant mieux. If not, tant pis. Lucia’s address is c/o Miss H. Weaver Loveland’s Cottage, Loveland’s Lane Lower Kingswood, Tadworth (Surrey) The price of the cloak or terms of payment should not be discussed either by letter or orally before Lucia or Miss Weaver, if, as is probable, the latter comes to town as she would then offer to pay for it. My wife says she is writing you separately. I hope this finds you both well and fixed for the winter. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
