  "text": "Lucia’s disqualification for the dancing prize was received by a strong protest from a good half of the audience (not friends of ours) who called out repeatedly ‘Nous réclamons l’irlandaise! Un peu de justice, messieurs!’ She got the best notice, I think. Another Paris link has snapped, Mme Puard, my old clinic nurse, having left for a sanatorium. As regards myself, I finished the 28 days iodine treatment but have not yet been back to Dr Hartmann. I have had too much to do, being up sometimes till 1.30 fooling over old books of Euclid and algebra. I have arranged to get Faktorovitch (who helps me in these matters) to review the Crosbye’s book on condition that he does not produce a mere flattery. He is a Russian (a bolshevik too and possibly a semi-official one) but I don’t mind as we never talk politics and he is most obliging but chiefly he represents a class of my readers which ought to have their say, i.e. the foreignborn admirers. To succeed O I am planning W that is a book of only 4 long essays by 4 contributors (as yet I have found only one—Crosbye—who has a huge illustrated edition of the Book of the Dead, bequeathed to him by his uncle)—the subjects to be the treatment of night (cf B of D and S. John of the Cross ‘Dark Night of the Soul’), the mechanics and chemistry, the humour and I have not yet fixed on the fourth subject. This for 1930, when I shall also, I hope, send out another fragment, this time about T with another preface, U and L having by that time passed into currency. I have also arranged for the translation into an Italian review of Beckett’s article and will try to do the same for Budgen’s in a Danish or Swedish one. I have also proposed to a young Dublin artist to do an illustration for the old earwig’s funeral (Time, Saturn) which, as you will see, I introduced into the Ondt and Gracehoper. And that, I think, ends my activities for the moment. Do not blame me for all this intriguing. I have little or no support and have to defend a difficult cause, whether right or wrong I no longer know or care two straws. As regards the dinner with E.P. and E.H. they had a fine friendly set-to midway over G.A. whom H accuses of simulated sickness, subscription seeking, semi-blackmail and so on, P replying that H is known for his mendaciousness. The description of both seeming to suit myself rather well I got them on to another subject. P then wanted me as ‘the leader of European prose’ (!) to write ‘an open letter’ denouncing, with Roth as pretext, everything American and proposing dire retribution on U.S. ambassadors, consuls etc. H said this was moonshine as it would do me no end of harm with thousands of Americans who had supported me and support me still. Of course while I argued pro and con with P I had not for a moment the faintest intention of taking his advice. By the way he is in London. Has he been to see you? He did not go to rue de l’Odéon. A.M. wants to get up a country picnic to celebrate Bloomsday and the French Ulysse. Two char-à-bancs full of people! I am afraid of the heatwave and storms and would much prefer a glass of milk and a bath bun like the Private Secretary who every day in every way seems to me a better and better Imitation of Christ. Pound says the most outrageously amusing things sometimes. Kicking his long legs around in the drawingroom he upset a little sacred image McGreevy (Lord knows why!) gave me at Xmas so that a thread got twisted round S. Joseph’s neck, E.P. exclaiming ‘Gee! I never knew that that blighter had been hanged too!’ Here I will stop for today because the editor of the Revue de France wants to see me in the next room about an article. I hope you were not at Guildford during that last bad storm I read of. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
