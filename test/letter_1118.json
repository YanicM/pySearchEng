  "text": "Dear Budgen: I have just heard from Mrs Suter that you are awaiting a word from me. I am still here but very rushed and worried about Lucia who had a nervous breakdown a month ago. She is at Hay-les-Roses for quiet. I should like you to see her initials (see enclosed). They will come out on 15 August, 19 copies having been sold to date. Louis Gillet, art critic for the Revue des Deux Mondes, wrote to me about them: ‘J’admire ces lettrines comme une merveille d’atavisme. On dirait des caprices d’un vieil enlumineur irlandais…. La T est étonnante. Vous me direz ce que je dois en faire. J’ai peur que nos artistes aient peu de chose à apprendre à cette jeune fille que guide la main de Saint Patrice ou Saint Colomban.’ Of course I can find time to see you and will be glad to talk with you but of course also I cannot give any engagement of any sort to an English publisher. Nine persons seem to be engaged in doing books about me at present. But how can you do the drawings without having visited Dublin?",
