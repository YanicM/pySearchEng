  "text": "Dear Mother I received the budget of cards &c on Monday morning but did not answer as the letters led me to expect something else. On Sunday night I did some washing (I could not spare any money for laundry) and hung it out to dry. On Monday I borrowed a few francs and took the train out to Saint-Cloud and came back to Paris in one of the little river-steamers. In the evening I went to the theatre. I had a letter and a cigarette-case from Aunt Josephine. The editor of the ‘Speaker’ wrote to [me] a day or so ago asking me to write a review of the French translation of Ibsen’s ‘Catilina’. I am doing so and hope to send it tomorrow if I can pay the postage I have not yet been paid by the ‘Express’ but I am sending them a critique of a première at Sarah Bernhardt’s theatre and a letter with it. Tell Pappie that when I was in London I went twice to see ‘Jimmy’ Tuohy but ‘Jimmy’ Tuohy was not there. I left a note for ‘Jimmy’ Tuohy saying I had to go on to Paris that night, telling him why I had called to see him, asking him could he be of any help, and giving him my address in Paris but ‘Jimmy’ Tuohy has not written to me yet. I expected to have had some definite news from you about the ‘Irish Times’. It would be quite easy for me to send any kind of news to that intelligent organ—motor news, dead men’s news, any news—for I have all the Paris papers at my disposal. It is strange that I have been able to do more with strangers that [sic] you can do with friends. I am naturally very pressed for money at present until ‘Men and Women’ starts so that sometimes I innocently seek out my acquaintance to ask after their health about lunch-time—a plan which succeeds with Frenchmen but fails with English and American. If you can wire me some money when you get this I shall be glad as I doubt if I can last till Tuesday. If ‘Men and Women’ allows me a thousand words a week that is £2–2–0– (I have sent them in my first contribution) and I do reviewing for the ‘Express’ and the ‘Speaker’ and if the ‘Irish Times’ is worked successfully I think I should make something over £200 a year. Tell Stannie to send me Grant Allen’s book and the February no of ‘S. Stephen’s’ Jim",
