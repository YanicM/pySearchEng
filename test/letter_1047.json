  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: This is the first instalment of a long serial letter covering the last few months…. Thanks for your good wishes for the New Year and second of February. I had a bad New Year and the worst birthday in history as I had no money and so was not able to make the usual reunion of all my friends here. I sat in the corner of the drawing room sulking and waiting for the arrival of camel loads of presents and volleys of telegrams but that was the good it did me. Towards evening my son and daughter-in-law arrived and taking compassion on me led me out to the Trianons. They had just come back from a honeymoon in Germany. I have sent away fourfifths of my books, keeping only dictionaries and books of reference. I also sent away my pictures to my son and sofas and odd objects of furniture. Besides which I am distributing sticks, cigarette-holders, prints and other mementos. I have also given the piano to my son. I am looking for a goodsized barrel in which to live, preferably a Guinness’s one. Everybody that I know seems to be either sick, broken or crazy when not all three together. Larbaud seems to be very ill. He is locked up in his flat and will not see anybody…. I have been working a great deal at this with Léon and Soupault and there is tremendous excitement about it, I believe, in the N.R.F. Miss Monnier is arranging a séance at which it is to be read by her or by an actress with my original English also and a speech by Soupault, after which I am to dance the Highland fling. I have also been working with Gorman for his biography, raking up documents and memories. He has written all over the globe and got lots of material…. My main interest is to see that the facts and dates are correct and this is the best opportunity. I am also trying to conclude section I of Part II but such an amount of reading seems to be necessary before my old flying machine grumbles up into the air. Personally the only thing that encourages me is my belief that what I have written up to the present is a good deal better than any other first draft I made. My insomnia is better. I have almost given up Sullivan’s case as hopeless though I hate being beaten…. Sullivan had an immense success in Italy….",
