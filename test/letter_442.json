I am much honoured by your kind proposal that I should contribute to your paper and I shall bear it in mind. I regret, however, that for the moment I am allowed to do very little reading or writing but hope that the change of weather may bring me some relief. With renewed thanks, believe me to be, dear sir, Sincerely yours James Joyce",
