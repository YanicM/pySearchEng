  "text": "Dear Mr Bergan: A few hours after I wrote you I had misgivings about the date (May was my Mother’s birth and marriage month) so I wrote to my sister, Mrs. Shaurek, 16 Mountjoy Square, to call at Harrison’s and alter it. I hope this has now been done. I should like model 2, which I have marked and am returning illustration of. I should also prefer to make one remittance instead of two, that is, £48–10–0 to cover Harrison’s bill and the maximum of cemetery fees. Will Messrs. Harrison agree to pay these fees for me, out of the check so made up? And also, will they put the work in hand now, and when do they undertake to finish it and have it erected? This letter is purely a business one, which I am dictating. I shall reply to the other parts of your letter in a few days. Sincerely yours, James Joyce",
