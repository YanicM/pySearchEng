  "text": "Dear Stannie: Am almost sure I heard the Schmitzes say a Kafka had translated some of his things. The F.Z. refuses to apologise and prints what I sent you from Dover. All the chief literary agencies in London have been rung up. None has ever heard of Michael Joyce. The British Museum catalogue has been searched for past 80 years. No record of any book of his. There is, however, a magazine run by the Cunard, P & O, Ellerman lines etc to encourage ocean cruises on their vessels. It is called The Blue Peter and a Michael Joyce is a contributor to it. In addition to writing begging letters I have refused thousands of pounds for years past because I would not write for the press on commission and now one of the leading European newspapers goes and puts my name under a fraudulent shoddy piece of journalese and will not even apologise for it. They had the thing in their hands for months, made no effort to get into touch with me or my publisher, never sent me a copy of the paper it appeared in or tried to pay me the big fee they knew I would be entitled to, infringed my German publisher’s contractual rights, refused to apologise when written to and published under a displeasing title an article which is mean, silly, impertinent and untrue. I’m going to sue them anyhow so that’s that. I hope you will be able to get the facts into the press. If so, send me 4 copies of any paper it appears in. I am sorry you have to toil amid that damn dreary correspondence and hope you are soon ‘through’ with it. Three hoots for Furtofranco Greetings to you both. Jim P.S. You know, you advised me to proceed against Roth and not ‘play the gentle Jesus always’. I did, though I presaw the result. Aha! Huff!",
