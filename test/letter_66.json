  "text": "Dear Pappie I am safely settled here after a good deal of wandering and a good deal of trouble. I am unable to tell you what I want you to do for Riviere till I get my trunk from Switzerland tomorrow. This is a new school here and nearly all my pupils are officers in the Austrian navy. This is the principal naval station on the Adriatic and there are ten or twelve men-o’-war always in the harbour. The town itself is very small. They speak three languages here—Italian, German (the official language) and Slav. The Italian they speak is however very corrupt. I am going to exchange exchange [sic] lessons with the German teacher here as I wish to speak it also. There are not more than three or four English people in the town and all are ‘lions’. I sent you an advt from the ‘Giornaletto’ and I had another one—a huge thing—in which I am billed as ‘dottore in filosofia’—Doctor of Philosophy—the Italian degree answering to mine. I shall send you a picture-card of Pola one of these days. It would be quite easy for Stannie to get a position in a Berlitz school in Europe if he cared to take it as they cannot get English teachers to come abroad: If he considers it tell him consult me as I now know the way these Berlitz schools are worked. He would not have to pay any fee. The weather is good summer here but I am pestered with mosquitoes all night. There was a little disturbance here after the Innsbrück [sic] riots but not much. I could have started in Trieste by myself as I had two tuitions but I preferred to come on here for the present. A Berlitz teacher is not allowed to give private lessons. Stannie tells me that the ‘Speaker’ has printed another poem of mine (and wrongly) and when I get my trunk I intend to send off more. I am enclosing a letter for Stannie. Please give it to him. I hope you are still in good health. Addio. Jim P.S. A letter will be read with pleasure.",
