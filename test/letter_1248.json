  "text": "Dear Eileen: I am sorry you had such an alarm and your daughters too. The affair seems mysterious. Is the bungalow on the top of Bray Head and what could any burglar hope to get by entering the house of any member of the Joyce family? I am short of cash this week end but on Tuesday will wire £5 more, £2 for you and £3 for Lucia. She must get used to handling money even if she spends some badly. Millions of women do that. The scenes that scared you and Miss Weaver are nothing to speak of. Her mother stood four years of very much worse than that. Lucia says Charley’s wife and Alice talked to her a lot about Jesus Mary and Aunt Josephine. If these two females are so damn pious how is it they bear no children? I shall write Lucia tomorrow as in any case you won’t get this before Monday. She also says Miss Weaver stole a bottle of cognac. Possibly the strain is driving her to drink. You have not answered any of my questions but this is excusable in the circumstances. I want to know exactly (apart from the £2 a week I will send you in lieu of your salary) what I have to pay as weekly board for you and Lucia. Mr Murphy will stay in London from Tuesday to Thursday or so but I will send you more details when I know them. I hope you have by now got over your fright. Anyhow things like that rarely happen twice in the same place. You are wrong in wanting to conceal the fact of your wiring from Lucia. The only way to get on with her is to be perfectly straightforward and honest as she is herself in spite of her loony ways. Greetings Jim P.S. I did not know that Irish Paddies celebrate their onomastico. However, if it gives you and him pleasure, I will send him a line for tomorrow. I mean Patrick.",
