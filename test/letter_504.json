  "text": "Dear Mr Richards: Thanks for your letter. My health is now better and I am allowed to work again. I received 2 copies of Dubliners and hope that the amount will be charged against my account. As you say it is impossible to send books here on sale or return terms I shall pay in advance for 6 copies at a time and try to sell them myself. Therefore I remit you M.O. for £1–1–0 being amount for 6 copies at trade price (2/6) and postage and also for 1 copy of Dubliners at trade price (2/6) and postage, this latter to be sent at once to Mrs Murray, 10 Fairfield road, Church road, Dublin. Mr William Archer, 27 Fitzroy Square, London W. writes to say that he did not receive the copy of Exiles which I instructed you to send him. This is very regrettable as Mr Archer is a critic of great influence. I hope you will see to this without delay. Will you send me a list of the persons to whom copies were sent? If so you will oblige me greatly and I shall know how to act. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Sending some new notices of my novel.",
