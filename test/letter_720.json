  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for your letter and enclosures and also for your telegram to which I shall reply tomorrow…. I return that letter and Mr Jaloux’s. I shall write to him. I dined with him the night before I left Paris and found him very friendly. I am keeping the letter from Ireland a little longer. I do not exactly like to suggest this to you but I think it would be very useful to me if your correspondence with the writer did not cease. It could be quite formal on your side and on his would become more and more informative perhaps. I think he may have known me. In any case it is the first chance I have had of looking into the back of the minds of his other correspondents. It would also serve for the propaganda of news such as that in the Evening Standard, the sale of the second edition and the proposal from the director of the Théätre National de l’Odéon (the full title to be given) and the articles in the Quarterly, English Review, Revue de Paris etc. This is not an idle addition for I do not despair of inflicting a few more blows. I believe I am right in thinking that the longrange gun from Paris is the most effective. This is apparent also in Mr ‘John Eglinton’’s article in The Dial, though the domestic event chronicled in the enclosed cutting also explains the softening of heart towards the longquesting hero of my telephone directory. I suppose it was you who sent Miss Beach the copy of the Quarterly which she forwarded. As a criticism or even an attack Mr Leslie’s article is rather ineffective but as a leading article (article 1 in an editorial obituary notice) in the most authoritative review in the Englishspeaking world it is very effective in a way which the writer did not at all intend. In the press extracts I think his statement of the book’s reception with ‘jocular contempt’ in Dublin might be placed near The Dial’s account of its enthusiastic welcome and in the mere indication of these two accounts to your Antrim correspondent who speaks of the rage with which it has been assailed would probably draw from him some interesting information which in any case he probably wishes to give away. Meanwhile I sketched a letter for Miss Beach to send to the critic of the Quarterly stating for his information that copies had been presented to Trinity and the National Library and acknowledged with thanks, that the British Museum ordered and paid for a copy and that only 17 press copies (unstitched, unnumbered and on ordinary paper) were circulated, 5 for the continent, 6 for England and 6 for America and that no press copy was sent to Ireland. The letter ended with a brief mention of the second edition. I am sure all this will seem very disingenuous to you but alas you must speak Helvetian to a Swiss is the experience of this voyageur malgré lui.",
