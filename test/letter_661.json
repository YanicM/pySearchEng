  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for the Italian papers which came this morning. I sent a verbal reply to your last question by Mr McAlmon who was leaving for London and said he would see you. I agree in advance to any scheme you may propose about the book. As regards my other suggestion I did not mean that you should advertise the other booksâ€¦. I have been obliged to reduce my working hours from about sixteen hours daily to six in consequence of an attack I got, some kind of syncope it seemed to be. It came on me in a musichall where I had gone with my son feeling my head too light for work. With his help and that of an agent I was got into a taxi and brought into a night pharmacy where they gave me some ether, I think. The attack lasted about two hours and, being very nervous, I was much alarmed. Since then I have been training for a Marathon race by walking 12 or 14 kilometres every day and looking carefully in the Seine to see if there is any place where I could throw Bloom in with a 50 lb weight tied to his feet. I have made a great deal of addition to the proofs so far (up to the end of Scylla and Charybdis). Perhaps you would like to see them. If so I shall send them on. I have also added a Messianic scene to Circe but the printer has not reached that yet. I hope you had a pleasant sojourn in the country. I have been a score of times to various railway stations here seeing people off and in and I feel vaguely that I should like to be going somewhere myself but by the time I am ready the winter equinox and the midnight sun and other impossible phenomena will all be in conjunction to make the weather truly antarctic. Please accept my very best wishes for your birthday and for many happy returns.",
