  "text": "Dear Budgen: I will write to you about your book in a day or so. Friday 1 September is Miss Weaver’s birthday. Will you please now ring her up and fix an hour for Thursday when you can deliver the picture. This as from yourself I will pay for the frame extra. Let me know the amount. If it is framed tant mieux. If not what about a bog oak one but beware of those swindlers in ‘Paddy and his pig’ shops. Either they will sell you black painted deal or promise you faithfully to have it ready for Thursday etc and then leave you in the lurch. It is a lustreless black fossil wood. One of my countless walking sticks is of bog oak, possibly you remember it. I hope Sargent saw that doctor and that all is right with him. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
