  "text": "Madam Allow me to thank you for the honour you have done me by including in an anthology recently brought out by you some verses of mine—I hear an army charging upon the land. I have not seen your anthology, but some days ago I saw a collection of verses brought out in New York which also contains these verses. This version and also that in your anthology from which it was taken contains two mistakes, viz: stanza 2, line 1 ‘into’ for ‘unto’ stanza 3 line 1 ‘grey’ for ‘green’. (v. Chamber Music (Elkin Mathews, London, 1907), p. 36). If a second edition of your anthology be called for perhaps you will be kind enough to make these two changes. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
