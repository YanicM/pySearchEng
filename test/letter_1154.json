  "text": "Dear Mr Brody: My son has just read me your letter over the telephone. I have not given permission to any firm in the U.S. or elsewhere to film Ulysses. I received from Messrs W B Yeats and Bernard Shaw an invitation to become a member of the new Irish Academy of Letters but declined it. I was not operated by Vogt in August. I have to return to Zurich every 3 months to be under observation by him for the next 12 or 18 months and then he will see whether he can operate or not. You may keep the designs until the Christmas season if you think there is a reasonable prospect of doing something with them. I received a letter from Goyert and referred him to you. It may interest you to know that the British Customs seized the whole 10 copies (9 sold in advance) of the English part of my daughter’s book of lettrines on account of the ‘carton’ classing it as ‘silk luxury goods’ and demanding a Chinese ransom of £4 per copy on a book which already costs £12 a copy. No wonder the £ is at 82 in the shade. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
