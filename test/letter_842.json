  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: There has been so much hammering and moving going on here that I could scarcely hear my thoughts and then I have just dodged an eye attack. In fact when I was last writing to you I felt pain and rushed off to the clinic where the nurse sent me on to Dr Borsch. He said I had incipient conjunctivitis from fatigue probably. Next day it was worse nevertheless he insisted I was not to put off a theatre engagement I had accepted (Chaliapine). I went but had to leave in mid-opera. He then told me it would be nothing if I went about and amused myself! It got better but I had three or four very unpleasant days. We are settling down here slowly but there is a dreadful lot to do. The Breton girl having ordered her furniture seems to have left us in the lurch. She does not answer letters. I daresay we shall get right in time. I suppose I ought to have made this move long ago but operations held me up for one thing and I knew it needed a big sum of money and though I knew I could probably get it I could not bring myself to ask for it in bulk. But now the fat is in the fire. I had the three living rooms which open up done in your colours, bluesea and seasand, thus, blue with yellow hangings, a neutral brown and the drawing room yellow with blue hangings. I am able to distinguish the blue from the yellow and viceversa. I hope you have the Contact book. I put in a few puzzles more into my piece. I am working hard at Shem and then I will give Anna Livia to the Calendar. Morel will have to type all again as my typist is away. I have got out my sacksful of notes but can scarcely read them, the pencillings are so faint. They were written before the thunder stroke. Tuohy has now sent two telegrams, having discovered that Martinmas is not in Derbyshire, I suppose. He wants to come here to paint me. I want him to go there to paint you. You want him to stay where he is and paint himself. He certainly wants me to pose myself and he certainly wants himself to pose me for himself and certainly he does now be wanting to paint me posed by himself, himself for myself. Is it dreadfully necessary (I mean that I pose etc) is it useful, I ask this We all know Mercury will know but as Dante saith: 1 Inferno is enough. Did Fossett change those words? They was two. Doesn’t matter. ‘Gromwelling’ I said and what? O, ah! Bisexycle that was the bunch. Hope he does, anyhow. O rats! It’s just a fool thing, style. I just shoot it off like: If he aint done it, where’s the use? Guess I’m through with that bunch. (With apologies to Mr Robert McAlmon) Have you made a copy of Raymond’s letter. I should like to show it to Morel. Did Miss Beach send you the Hamburg paper. What a cheerful figure I must have looked at that Penman’s Banquet! With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
