I was obliged to pay both landladies, as the disappointed one came to the restaurant and made a scene. I will send A a cheque for 40 on the 28th. I am trying, since you say Trieste is off, to get a position in France. I have made a lovely pasticcio, it seems. Anyway you must send me some money by return of post as I have no means of getting any. I cannot get beyond Thursday. Jim",
