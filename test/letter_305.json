  "text": "Dear Nora I received letter from London. My usual luck! Am surprised that Stannie has not written about the house. Why have you not sent me a line? Perhaps I shall have one in the morning. I have no idea how we can manage to get home as I have to hand out money here constantly. How are you? I was shown yesterday an article I had not seen on Chamber Music in the Liverpool Courier. They speak of my verses as ‘exquisite and passionate poems’. Can your friend in the sodawater factory or the priesteen write my verses? I spoke of you all night with my aunt. Jim",
