If you are not too busy I should be much obliged if you could type some more of my incomprehensible MS. If convenient to you we can meet at the corner of Avenue Gabriel tomorrow (Monday) at 6.30 or so. If not will you please leave word for me what hour and place will suit you. With kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
