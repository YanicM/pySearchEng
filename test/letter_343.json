I am sorry to hear that your printers have mislaid the pages you mention, but I enclose typed copies of them (pp 3–4 and 13–14) so that they can proceed with the printing without further delay. May I ask you when sending me the first batch of proofs for revision to send back also the original printed title page of the Dublin edition? I hope this page has not gone astray as I should be sorry to lose it. Hoping that no further incidents may now retard the publication of the book in May next I am very sincerely yours James Joyce",
