  "text": "Dear Budgen: Thanks for remembering my birthday. Ruggiero did so too. I hope you are all well. Did you offer your article elsewhere? I have had many more since, Italian, one from Magdeburg, one by a Russian American, a remarkable one and, naturally enough perhaps, a strange symbolical affair from Helsinki—sent about 6 weeks ago-where, as foretold by the prophet, the Finn again wakes. I should not jest…. And what about a second edition of your book. Gorman’s life of me is out. It is published by Farrar and Reinhardt [sic] of N.Y. I hope the Cardiff man paid you for your pictures. There was plenty of snow down here to paint near Vichy where the water comes from.",
