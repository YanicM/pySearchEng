  "text": "Dear Stannie, The notary says it is useless to make a sworn statement before him. I am to make a simple declaration, send it to you, who, as curator, are to recognise it in a sworn statement as true. I am busy and worried. American lawyers refused to take up this case but at last I have got one who says he will try to stop the publisher by backstairs influence. The American press, to which my publisher cabled and wrote does not publish cable or letter and continues to print Rothâ€™s full-page advertisements, knowing them to be a swindle. He is pocketing at least 1,000,000 francs a month. I am also very hard at work. Do not tell me for the moment any more details, but propose to me some temporary plan and say what you suggest I do, say, till March. I go then to Lugano for a week or so and we could meet. Many happier returns of the 17th. Regards to Eileen and children. Jim",
