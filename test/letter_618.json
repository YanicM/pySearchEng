  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: First of all excuse me for not having acknowledged till now the receipt of the novel you sent. I have been ill for the past few weeks with my eyes but luckily it did not reach the iris. It is better now and I can begin to read and write again though I am plagued by violent neuralgia. The nerves of my head are in such a bad way that I think Circe must be revenging herself for the unpleasant things I have written about her legend. I am sure you are bored by my eternal changing about and fits of illness and long intervals during which I send on no more of Ulysses. I shall try to finish the Circe episode before Christmas. The next one is already drafted but this has cost me an incredible amount of labour. A Mrs Yasuki Tanaka is writing a special article about Ulysses in the review published by the university of Washington, The Pacific Review, in which, as she writes, she alludes to it as ‘a dark and deep book’. I hear that after a lapse of several months the Little Review came out on 25 November with all the Oxen of the Sun episode and an account of the preliminary trial. The case comes on again next Monday the 13th—a lucky number for me and also the day of S. Lucia, the patron of eyes—so that I suppose the case will be ——? Exiles is not to appear in book form but on the stage. I do not know the date yet, sometime in February. It was withdrawn in Munich after the first performance and the agency in Berlin thinks it is better to let the echo of that fiasco die away before offering it elsewhere. I have not heard from Mr Linati lately about the Italian version or from the Swedish translator of the novel who proposed, by the way, to omit the philosophical and free passages. The Spanish translator possibly may wish to retain these and omit the rest and a combination of both versions would suffice for the central European if he or she could read both those languages. I am still keeping the third act of Esuli as there is an article in the review which I ought to read but the print is indistinct and fatigues me. In one of your letters, which I cannot refer to here, you mentioned some book or writings of —— on the subject of prophecy. It was in connection with the articles in a Viennese paper about the coincidence of A Painful Case. May I ask you for the name of the writer? I sent you on the article in The Dial. It is rather curious that I have already a fair collection of reviews of an unpublished book. If Mr Huebsch decides to print it possibly the series of reviews will not be discontinued.",
