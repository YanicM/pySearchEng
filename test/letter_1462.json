  "text": "Dear Budgen: I forgot to say Louis Gillet told me last week he had bought a copy of your book marked: 4th impression. Is this worth looking into? Was there any but a first edition which was remaindered (Léon has been trying to get a copy for private use) or is this a ruse of the publishing firm to give a false idea of sales or is an edition out without your knowledge? If you reply to this write only about it in your letter so that I can forward it to him (better type it) or wire yourself to him direct, 17 rue Bonaparte, Paris 7e. He is an academician. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
