  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I did not leave Paris and even now doubt that I can. I found the projected trip London-Torquay too expensive, then rioting broke out here and we did not like to face American-frequented resorts in the south at least till after the 20th when the Legion Parade is over. Foreigners are being rounded up and we have to see to our identity cards. So I sent the children for 10 days to the channel coast and we stayed on here. I was besides working on the revision of Z which I finished Monday and had to work over the end of the German translation of Oxen of the Sun. It comes out on the 25 instant: 350 copies…. MacLeish wrote that he thought the bookseller could raise the price of the Dubliners copy so I cabled him to fix it at £200 and pay in that sum to Messrs Monro Saw for repurchase of the last two lots of stock…. My sight is not good, many operations have made [me] more diffident than ever. Some of the hostile criticisms of my new work seem to me imbecile but I would agree to sacrifice 1/4 if the rest is read or printed to be read and there is no other way. By 1 April I suppose Ulysses will be in a 10th edition and translated into German and French. I suppose I have spent a good 10,000 hours writing Pts 1 and 3 but I could not undertake even to sketch part 2 and the end unless my mind during the time is completely freed from strain. What happens after does not much matter. There is also the lawsuit. The reason the other writers robbed did not intervene is because they did not care to risk their money in an American court. They will probably make a concerted move if Roth loses.",
