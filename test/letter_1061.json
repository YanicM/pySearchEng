  "text": "Dear Miss Beach: I have taken this tiny place at a low rent, about I forget how much, till 25 September. I return Mr S’s letter. I sent Miss Monnier several signed copies of H.C.E. for distribution. When I receive the 7 copies of the N.R.F. I shall sign and return. Can you [not] extract a letter or a p. c. from Babou even in exchange for my present to say that he authorizes publication here? If the piece falls into other hands tomorrow I shall be victimized by that wretched contract I signed. It is useless to apply to Léon on that or any other subject till the end of June next. I telephoned him and telegraphed but in vain. Did J. Paulhan get my letter asking him to send the French A.L.P. to George Moore? If he has not done so it ought not now to be sent. I got a most furious letter from G.M. which Gilbert will show. And A.L.P. in French will only make him worse. I replied sweetly and suavely. Old men have a right to their anger…. And yes a copy of A.L.P. in French should go to Sullivan. I think Miss Monnier should record the reading of A.L.P. for Coppola and sell the discs. My plan for pleasantly surprising Mr Colum has fallen through temporarily. I have not seen anybody here save T.S.E. and Hughes.",
