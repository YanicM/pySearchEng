  "text": "Dear Stannie: The Piccolo does not contain either in report or Pasini’s speech any allusion to the telegram I sent that morning or to your presence among the professors or to Larbaud and Miss Monnier or to myself. Whoever eventually writes the preface to Senilità should mention that fact. Thanks for your wire. The other branches of the family (Paris excepted) expressed consternation. I had offered my nephew George who is workless £1 a week if he would help me with my notes from 2 to 5 pm every day but his stepmother (he is 21) took from him the Exagmination I had lent him and we were given to understand that our influence etc etc. The Press Association by the way but particularly the Sunday Express made a most spirited attempt at blackmail but funked it at the end, the rumour having gone around that I had come in for a big sum which would enable me to fight them for libel. The affair as you know is as clear as mock turtle. Having eloped with my present wife in 1904 she with my full connivance gave the name of Miss Gretta Greene which was quite good enough for il Cav. Fabbri who married us and the last gentleman in Europe il conte Dandino who issued the legitimate certificates for the offspring, but this full connivance voided the marriage in the eyes of English law see Hargreave’s Laws of England page 471–2 and the second ceremony was thought advisable to secure the inheritance under will. I have a slight cough this morning so please forgive me if I now desist. With best Xmas wishes to Mr and Mrs Joyce from Mr and Mrs Ditto MacAnaspey and here’s jumping that bucket as Tinker said to his gipsy I remain, dear professor, matrimonially yours Monico Colessee",
