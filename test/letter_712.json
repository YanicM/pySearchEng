  "text": "Dear Lady Gregory: I am recovering from a dangerous eye illness which has lasted three months and therefore am dictating this reply to your letter of July twenty seventh. While thanking you for the friendly remembrance contained in it, and for acts of kindness in the past I shall feel very much obliged if you will omit from your forthcoming book, which I understand is largely a history of the Irish literary movement, all letters of mine and all mention of me. In doing so you will be acting strictly in accordance with the spirit of that movement, inasmuch as since the date of my letter, twenty years ago, no mention of me or of my struggles or of my writings has been made publicly by any person connected with it. Mr. Pound has enclosed with your letter, a letter from Mr. Yeats to him in which there are several kind expressions concerning my book Ulysses. May I ask you to be kind enough to convey to Mr. Yeats, for whose writing I have always had great admiration, my thanks for his favorable opinion, which I value very highly. Believe me, dear Lady Gregory, Sincerely yours James Joyce",
