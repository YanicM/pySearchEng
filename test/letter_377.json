  "text": "I am here with wife and children (two aged ten and eight). For the last six months I have had great difficulty in living. In order to leave Trieste I had to raise money on my furniture. The fare and other expenses here brought that supply to an end. I have of course no means of support though I am looking for lessons every day. I have received a small amount of money from a connection of mine by marriage and it is this at present which keeps me and my family. I cannot count on any definite supply from that source as he has his own family and is not rich…. I suppose I shall receive nothing in the way of royalties…. Perhaps when the scholastic year begins again in October I can find some kind of teaching here in Switzerland, either in Zurich or in French Switzerland. This is my hope, I am afraid I cannot go back to Trieste for some time to come…. The last raid of Italian airships, as I read, was directed against the Trieste shipyard, about five minutes from my house.",
