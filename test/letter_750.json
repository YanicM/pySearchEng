  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: We are staying here. Hotels are full up and we have had two days of a wild house chase. Dr Borsch will not be back till 6 September. My dentist is also out of town. So is Mr Davidson whom I cannot see till Tuesday. He turns out to be a friend of mine (or acquaintance). I had not connected him with the affair. I telephoned to Mrs Davidson who told me that her husband got a wireless message from Miss Lewisohn who is the proprietress of a New York theatre asking him to telegraph to me and then to her as they want to put the play into rehearsal. This message came from mid ocean as they had bought the play to read on the boat. Many thanks indeed for so kindly typing those clauses. They will be very useful. I shall suggest they be forwarded, filled in, sent back and then forwarded to Mr Pinker for ratification if he thinks the terms adequate. Mr Pound has a good opinion of these people. I shall write to you on Tuesday or Wednesday. With kindest regards and many thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
