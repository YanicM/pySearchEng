  "text": "Dear Nora I have had no letter from you today and hope you have not written any to me addressed to Galway. I forgot to tell you not to. I am in a wretched state of confusion and weakness on account of doing what I told you. When I woke up this morning and remembered the letter I wrote you last night I felt disgusted with myself. However if you read through all my letters from the beginning you will be able to form some idea of what I feel towards you. I have not enjoyed one day of my holidays. Your mother remarked my habit of sighing and said I would break my heart by it. I suppose it must be bad for me. I hope you take that cocoa every day and are getting a little fatter on it. I suppose you know why I hope that. I am worried to death about you, myself, the return journey and Eva. I hope Stannie will wire me enough for both of us. Dublin is a detestable city and the people are most repulsive to me. I can eat nothing I am so agitated. When is this cursed thing going to end? When am I going to start? My brain is empty. I can write nothing to you tonight. Nora, my ‘true love’, you must really take me in hand. Why have you allowed me to get into this state? Will you, dearest, take me as I am with my sins and follies and shelter me from misery. If you do not I feel my life will go to pieces. Tonight I have an idea madder than usual. I feel I would like to be flogged by you. I would like to see your eyes blazing with anger. I wonder is there some madness in me. Or is love madness? One moment I see you like a virgin or madonna the next moment I see you shameless, insolent, half naked and obscene! What do you think of me at all? Are you disgusted with me? I remember the first night in Pola when in the tumult of our embraces you used a certain word. It was a word of provocation, of invitation and I can see your face over me (you were over me that night) as you murmured it. There was madness in your eyes too and as for me if hell had been waiting for me the moment after I could not have held back from you. Are you too, then, like me, one moment high as the stars, the next lower than the lowest wretches? I have enormous belief in the power of a simple honourable soul. You are that, are you not, Nora? I want you to say to yourself: Jim, the poor fellow I love, is coming back. He is a poor weak impulsive man and he prays to me to defend him and make him strong. I gave others my pride and joy. To you I give my sin, my folly, my weakness and sadness. Jim",
