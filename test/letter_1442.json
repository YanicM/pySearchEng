  "text": "Dear Mrs Sax; My wife saw your sister twice this week. She, your sister, said the tonic Dr Fontaine gave her did her great good. By the way our doctor is a woman and a very clever one too. In fact Lui is a Lei as in that libretto. Your sister asked me for the name of a good hotel at Montreux. I advised the Monnet where we stayed some years ago. She left the other night, so far as I know, but we could not go to the station as here, in Passy, there was thunder overhead and when thereâ€™s an orage my place is under the mattress. We have not left for Berne. We hardly know where we are going or when. We might end up in Tasmania. I hate the summer and the storms and the heat and the crowds and the long days and all the nationals out for all the nature they can find. If we move I will let you know. Tanti saluti a Lei ed a Lui. James Joyce",
