  "text": "Dear Larbaud: Thanks for your new book with the very kind words about me in it. I want to show you what I have done in the hope that it may continue to interest you. I shall have a fair lot ready in a week or so and perhaps you would like to see the typescript. How I write in present circumstances I don’t know—influence of ad maiorem dei gloriam, perhaps. I was sorry to hear your health was not good but the last reports are more favourable. As soon as I have once more presented my credentials (MSS) to you can we not have a quaresimal dinner somewhere together? I hope so. With very kind regards and my sincere thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
