  "text": "Dear Stannie My memory has got so damn bad that I forgot to enclose you the cutting from a Trieste paper about the publication of Ibsen’s letters under the editorship of his son, Sigurd: here it is. Hauptmann’s last play ‘Elga’ was produced the night before last in Berlin. In D’Annunzio’s new play ‘The Light under the Bushel’ his son is an actor. I have read in the Figaro of the divorce of the Irish Joan of Arc from her husband. Pius the Tenth, I suppose, will alter Catholic regulations to suit the case: an Italian comment says Irish genius is not domestic. Poor little U.I.: indignant little chap. What in my letter did Pappie find lunatic? Damn you, I don’t want ‘Hallow Eve’ back again. Sell it to Mighty AUM, and forward the money. Renan is a good writer but he makes me think of a Parisian gentleman who said to me one night in great flurry at parting time, ‘Alors, monsieur, au plaisir. Ici je prendrai tramway mais d’abord faut que je prenne water-closet’. Your account of your own boredom often amuses me. What is this I hear about Charlie and philosophy? I am not letting my beard grow. Nora sings sometimes when she is dressing—is that what you mean? At present she is licking jam off a piece of paper. She is very well, wears a veil now and looks very pretty. Just now she came in and said ‘The landlady has her hen laying out there. O, he’s after laying a lovely egg.’ Jaysus! O Jaysus! By the bye—in case I forget it—do not omit to slap Skeffington three times smartly on the bottom when you meet him next and say you ‘My brother that was in Polà is going to send you your two guineas, he says’. I have been reading ‘Confidence’, ‘Monsieur Bergeret à Paris’ by Anatole France and ‘Peter Simple’ by Capt. Marryat: and I prefer the last of the three. It seems to me much better than most of the modern scamped adventure-stories. ‘Confidence’ is almost readable on account of its inoffensiveness but it is neither delicate nor rich enough for my taste and I found it in no way interesting. Anatole France has a very high reputation but silence is my comment after reading two books—perhaps his worst. He is an intellectual socialist, I understand. In ‘Elga’ Hauptmann again uses the mechanism of a dream or vision. He is a very beautiful type of civilisation, in my opinion, and I wish I had leisure enough to interpret him. I have read (in German) a play by Hejermans—Ahasver but it is nothing, I have read H.J. consecutively and am now hesitating between De Amicis, A. France and Maupassant for a plunge. I think I shall take De Amicis. Would you be surprised if I wrote a very good English grammar some day? I have been sending you and Aunt J some picture postcards. It is a rather pretty game, don’t you think? I have finished Chapters XV. XVI. XVII. XVIII and will send them if you like. The U. College episode will take about ten chapters and I thought of keeping all till it was ended. On the other hand that is a hell of a time for you to wait. I have received your letter which interested me very much but if you knew what the feuilletons and short sketches in French papers [are] you would understand my embarrassment. Is Starkey’s book any good? I think Gogarty must use a typewriter: I do not think he could write consecutively enough for an article without some mechanical aid. I have become very cautious with money. Lothair bought a jewel cross for his wife which cost him £10,000: this I can understand. One evening he ‘threw the cabman a sovereign’—this I cannot understand. He cannot have had a very fine conscience on some points. You would smile to see me holding for a lower price in goloshes or reckoning a waiter’s bill after him. Nora is looking at ‘T.P.’s Weekly’ and asks ‘Is this the Ibsen you know?’ I believe that Ibsen and Hauptmann separate from the herd of writers because of their political aptitude—eh? .Jim Nora says I am to tell you she is axing at you!",
