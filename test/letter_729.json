  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for the cheque of royalties which I would have acknowledged before now but that I was hoping Mr Jaloux’s article would appear. It has not appeared but it may be in the next (1 January) number—the review is fortnightly…. It was very kind of you to take all that trouble about my longlost relative. I know nothing about him except what the patron of my hotel told me, that a man called, asked did I (writer etc) live there and begged him, the patron, to give me his card. As the scrawl on the back seemed to indicate much interest (possibly of a tribal kind) in the book I thought it would be useful to let him see the leaflet.1 Of press notices. From what you say he is probably a son of a certain yachtsman known as Tommy Joyce (a remote cousin of my father’s whom, strange to say, he resembled slightly) of Clontarf where I last saw him about a quarter of a century ago at an incomprehensible regatta walking in white shoes with a gait which suggested that he would progress equally well on shipboard in rough weather. This possibly explains why his son drops cards about whenever he comes to Paris. And now enough about them father and son, for one of the breed is more than enough. I am sorry to hear of the 400 copies seized. Has Mr Quinn been informed of it? Is this seizure legal? Parts of the book (copyrighted in U.S.A.) were condemned by a district court under state law but the Customs is a federal institution and what authority has a Customs official to sequestrate without compensation valuable foreign mail?…. Mr Larbaud told me that he wants to get to work, beginning next February, on what he calls Fragments d’Ulysses—that is the translation of certain parts of Ulysses and their publication in book form here in a limited edition. I objected that it would make my hero seem a mutilé de guerre and he then agreed to modify his plan so as to produce a skeleton of the book, with—but that’s a worse image no—a mariner’s chart where some regions are fully done, others sketched, others indicated and the whole representative. This plan has two advantages. It will leave it open for him or any other to fill in and complete his work. It will allow me to send out to the world in those parts where he uses critical exegesis certain suggestions as to the scheme and technique which I shall then have the pleasure of rehearing and rereading when they have gone the rounds. The book would be published by Miss Monnier at 100 francs, I think. It is difficult to know whether this will catch you on Christmas morning but I hope it will. Please accept my thanks for all your kind attention to me in London this year and with them my best wishes for a happy and quiet Christmas after all the trouble Ulysses II has given you.",
