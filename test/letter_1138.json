  "text": "Dear Mr Bergan, Thanks very much for your letter. I return you, as you wish, the catalogues. I prefer Design No. 120 which is the simplest, and enclose the inscription. Will Messrs. Harrison please let me know the total cost, and also when the headstone can be erected, and the manner and time of payment which they desire? I am staying here with my wife and daughter who, I am glad to say, is much better, but must return to Zurich in a week or so and then to Paris. But any letter sent me here will be forwarded. I remember quite well Mr. Harding, and heard from our common friend Patrick Hoey in Ostend a few years ago a very amusing description of the attendance at his funeral. I am very grateful for all the trouble you are taking on my behalf. Sincerely yours, James Joyce P.S. Would it be possible to have the whole done in white marble, gravestone and headstone, or is this for some technical reason, or on account of some regulation in the cemetery, not advisable?",
