  "text": "I am sending you 60 Lire, and will write to you fully on this absorbing question tomorrow. Cannot send it today as the P.O. is closed. Have not replied to G.R. but have written the whole account to Arthur Symons. I shall hope to write to G.R. when Symons answers. Tomorrow I am going to interview an international jurist. Have been to the English consul who gave me the address of their adviser. Georgie, I fear, has an attack of bronchitis. If not better tomorrow I will call in a doctor. What about the Celtic Fringe now? Only once more, love. Give it up, Jimmy, old boy. [Unsigned] New item. The landlady has just raised the rent of our room. How thoughtful! P.P.S. I have a new story for Dubliners in my head. It deals with Mr Hunter.",
