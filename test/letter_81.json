  "text": "Dear Stannie Why do you put a note of exclamation after the sentence about Doran’s article? It seems to me a strange subject: I should like to read the article. Your mention of Ibsen leads me to enclose you this cutting from a Trieste paper. I wish I knew enough Danish to read the volumes. What kind is the article on Ibsen in T P? I notice that articles on Ibsen have very attractive titles. On what authority did you write to me ‘All they said at Finn’s Hotel was that Miss Barnacle had gone away’? Is Mrs Wright a fixture there. (This is putrid ink) Your compliment (Coppée and myself) is rather chilly: but I have not my instruments with me (as you know) or I should not be forced to apply to others for help. I thought Curran knew the proposed length of the opus—what is this about care or cure? I have read Renan’s ‘Life of Jesus’ (I asked you to send me Strauss): it is a model of good writing in many ways: the temper is delightful. The narrative of the death I may perhaps translate for you. He calls John the Baptist the absinthe of the divine feast. I have read the Sorrows of Satan, A Difficult Matter (Mrs Lovett Cameron) The Sea Wolves (Max Pemberton) Resurrection and Tales (Tolstoy) Good Mrs Hypocrite (Rita) Tragedy of Korosko (Conan Doyle) Visits of Elizabeth (Elinor Glyn) and Ziska. I feel that I should be a man of letters but damn it I haven’t the occasion yet. You have nothing to do—why don’t you write full letters? I am getting some stories of Jakobsen (in German) and the Feast at Solhoug (also in German) to read. I have progressed a great deal in German. Read Siren Voices and report. ‘There would be’ (il y aurait) tell the torpid one is not an inversion. Tell him also that I am going to write a ‘Dubliner’ on him. Where is ‘Hallow Eve’ at present? Take it to the I.H. again and kiss Russell from me. You might send me some report of modern English literature. Why doesn’t Aunt Josephine write? I have sent you all information I have about the cheque and expect your reply to cross this. It seems to me that what astonishes most people in the length of the novel is the extraordinary energy in the writer and his extraordinary patience. It would be easy for me to do short novels if I chose but what I want to wear away in this novel cannot be worn away except by constant dropping. Gogarty used to pipe ‘63’ in treble when I told him the number of the chapters. I am not quite satisfied with the title ‘Stephen Hero’ and am thinking of restoring the original title of the article ‘A Portrait of the Artist’ or perhaps better ‘Chapters in the Life of a Young Man’. If I had a phonograph or a clever stenographist I could certainly write any of the novels I have read lately in seven or eight hours. Your satirical surprise at my proposed ‘dedication’ of ‘Dubliners’ to you arises, I imagine from an exaggerated notion you have of my indifference to the encouragement I receive. It is difficult for anyone at my age to be indifferent. I am not likely to die of bashfulness but neither am I prepared to be crucified to attest the perfection of my art. I dislike to hear of any stray heroics on the prowl for me. I think that by the time my novel is finished I shall be a good German and Danish scholar and, if Brandes is alive, I shall send it to him. I have come to accept my present situation as a voluntary exile—is it not so? This seems to me important both because I am likely to generate out of it a sufficiently personal future to satisfy Curran’s heart and also because it supplies me with the note on which I propose to bring my novel to a close. I suppose you will receive this letter on Saturday or Sunday. Address your next letter to the Trieste school, Via S. Nicolo, 32, as I am transferred there. I leave Pola on Sunday morning for Trieste, but if any letters from you are on the way they will follow me. I shall see at once about your entering the Berlitz School. Here are some particulars: England, Ireland and Scotland are controlled from London. France, Spain, Portugal and, I think, Germany are controlled from Paris. Austria-Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Greece, Egypt are controlled from Vienna. You should apply to these centres according to where you want to go. This is not a good time as all posts are usually full but there may be vacancies. In September you would have no difficulty. If it is your intention to wait till September enter at once and pass the Matric. Exam of the Royal University, as a University certificate would be very useful to you. Collect besides all your other certificates and your birth-certificate. If you decide to go you must study colloquial French as you will then be able to pass anywhere in the continent except of course with the common people. If you want to go before September write and let me know and I will see if there are at present any vacancies under the control of the Vienna office. An agent would charge you three guineas, but if you go to an agent send me his name first and I will tell you if you can trust him. The following from experience: grow a moustache, pretend to know everything, and dress magnificently. If you do this you will get on better. What country do you want to go to? I will tell you where you will have most to do. You can easily live on half the pay you receive in France, Italy or Germany, but this place is very dear. Answer this letter as quickly and as fully as you can. I have suffered a good deal from the lack of the papers I asked you for. Faithfully Yours Jaysus! amn’t I stupid to write that. Jim",
