  "text": "Dear Ford: The proof (sent me without the former one to check it by!) is quite impossible. I glanced over it. Not only has it not been read but many of the most glaring blunders are still in it. I gave the typescript to you, as you remember, under pressure and on the distinct understanding that I could write in notes to which I had not then access. I think it is due to me to hold over the piece for your next issue as the printer seems to be still learning his trade. If you can call today before 5 I shall explain to you why in my opinion it is necessary to make these apparently trifling additions. Your maid does not know where I can find you. I thought it better to drive up here in the hope of finding you rather than send a pneu. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
