I have not written any verse for many years now and regret therefore that I am unable to contribute to your venture to which, however, I wish all success. I read your postscript with great interest and I hope that distinguished officer, your grandfather, did not lament too lyrically his purchase of my book but that it afforded him some moments of entertainment at least. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
