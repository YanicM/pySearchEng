  "text": "Dear Larbaud: I hope all continues well. I have had to undergo a long cross-examination on the topic you can imagine but I was as the lamb et non aperui os meum. As regards your questions I think the fewer quotation marks the better. We would not write the phrase—the best of all possible worlds—in English between ‘’. Or in the French version ‘M. de la Palice was alive etc.’ And when the words half quoted are from an obscure writer p.e. ‘orient and immortal wheat’ (from Thomas Traherne) what does it help a French reader to see ‘’ there. He will know early in the book that S.D.’s mind is full like everyone else’s of borrowed words. The ‘’ are to be used only in the case of a quotation in full dress, I think, i.e. when it is used to prove or to contradict or to show etc. Do you agree? I am orribilmente occupato. Italo Svevo sent me the portrait of his wife (Livia) by Veruda and two U.S.A. publishers to my astonishment have just made me an offer of $11,000 (dico, undicimila dollari) in advance royalties on my ‘work in progress’. Seeing the nature of that work it is extraordinary, I think. I thought we should have met down there. Enjoyed it but it was too short. I must get away again. A twelvemonth year in Paris is no joke….",
