  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: We got back here a few days ago. I could not write before or even dictate because S.G. was with me and part of the letter should have been about himself. We got on very well together. He has prepared an extension of his article in T-13 with an explanation verbatim of the paragraph about poaching and fishing. I suggested to him to do this with three color pencils using the first for the words and phrases which presented no difficulty to him; the second for those which became clearer after two or three readings or from remembrance of other parts of the text; and the third for what remained insoluble. It turned out that this last was only a small percentage and though it included things which were very obvious (for instance the word nippy which is known to three or four fifths of the population of London as a nickname for a Lyons tea shop girl and almost as current as midinette in Paris) he did not know; having lived twenty years in the East before the word got current, but I insisted on his leaving this and appealing to the reader for help. He also read me in Salzburg several chapters or rather sketches of chapters, of his exposition of Ulysses which is almost wholly technical and much more detailed than that of Jordan Smith, if that is his name. I suggested to him to link it up here and there with Berard’s book on the Phoenician origin of the Odyssey and also with the work in progress. The translation is now finished. V.L. sent me a list of difficulties which I solved for him and informed me that he would celebrate his birthday twenty ninth of August, by going off his diet of milk and rusks in favor of some wine of the country in my honor and to celebrate both events. His work is now at an end. A.M. the translator. Had taken a good deal of license here and there, sometimes incorporating whole sentences of his own manufacture. These were struck out. The translation is really his and has been done with great care and devotion, but like many other people, by dint of brooding on it he sees one aspect to the exclusion of another. In his case it is the coarseness which excludes the others. Or perhaps I should say the violence. I said to A.M. (the publisher) about these bits ‘a little too much Madagascar here.’ He is in fact a French colonial born. Perhaps this explains it. I hope the three patch up their differences when the work is out. SG’s work was very useful but it was absolutely necessary to have VL’s final revision as he is very accurate; slow, fastidious and rather timid. I saw, or rather was shown, the prospectus yesterday; which A.M. brought me along with some other difficulties which I solved much to her delight. The prospectus will be out this week and the volume of nearly a thousand pages in December or January, which in France, usually means June, but in this case will probably be speeded up to mean the second of February. She is having it printed by a very old established printer (1500 and something) at Chartres under the shadow of the Cathedral almost. She brought me down there to see the place which is a few miles from her place in the country, and insisted on lighting a candle for me in the Cathedral, all for good luck. She becomes more and more superstitious, thinks that V.L. is bewitched by L.P.F. and I wish she could find out who is bewizarding me, for I have at the present moment, and all for my own self, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, blepharitis and a large boil on my right shoulder. So much for candles. Besides which I am most uncommonly fatigued and it is a physical impossibility for me to attempt revision of the piece for T-14 which therefore will have to come out without me for they have been ringing me up ever since I got back. The case against Roth is up for next month. At the last moment almost Conner’s partners in N.Y. cabled me that I ought to withdraw the suit for damages as there was no copyright case and get an injunction against use of name. There never was any case on copyright and I understood always that it was to be tried under the law of property but as it would have been folly for me to have opposed the opinion of American lawyers on the spot, and as on the other hand, I considered that I held to a certain extent a position of trust, I instructed them, if they had satisfactory means of knowing that Roth had so disposed of all the money which he had made in America by misuse of my name and mutilation of my text that no considerable part of it could be recovered either under copyright or property laws, to press for some judgment, an injunction against further use of my name with nominal damages of one dollar, or whatever is the American equivalent for the English farthing, a judgment; that is, which when recorded, would establish a precedent in case law in favor of unprotected European writers whose cause in this matter was the same as my own. The bill of costs will now come rolling across the Atlantic. I think they were probably influenced by the number of offers which have been recently made me for the publication of W. in P. work in progress. But I had these offers made to them and through them simply in order to substantiate the claim for damages which they were advancing when the case came into court. At all events D.F. has transferred his copyright of my property (and most uncommon kind of him) to me, that is part one, and Conner’s partners at my instruction and at my expense, have printed and deposited at Washington, copyright dummies in my name for the fragments in T.10-12 and 13. A.L.P. has not yet arrived but I expect her every day. I promised Drinkwater that I would reserve a copy for him though it is not easy to do this with such an edition. Did Miss Beach send you copies of photos he took of us and his letter in which he said that his wife, under the influence of reading me, had announced that she was terribly sick of bluggage. I think it not impossible that he may consent to do a preface for another fragment and I even thought of proposing to Gage [sic] that he ask Edgar Wallace to do one, the tortoise and the hare. I have received three offers to give a series of lectures in Switzerland, two most urgent letters in which that extraordinary person Mr. Wilson of Willington announces his willingness to pay mine and my wife’s expenses up there and back and hotel expenses and what he calls a royal welcome from the miners and for all I know a present of a few tons of coal also. He sent me some sort of a gift, I am not sure whether it is a cartridge coach [sic] or a case for cigars and cigarettes. It is rather embarrassing to reply. I also had a visit from a very high up person of the Russian Embassy here. Full of great admiration and proposing to bring me là-bas. But from all I can gather the condition of that country is dubious enough without inflicting on it the blighting influence of my one-quarteried personality. I have also bad news. Poor Italo Svevo was killed on Thursday last in a motor accident. I have no details yet only a line from my brother and so I am waiting before I write to his widow. Somehow in the case of Jews I always suspect suicide though there was no reason in his case especially since he came into fame, unless his health had taken a very bad turn. I was very sorry to hear of it but I think his last five or six years were fairly happy. About fifty pages of Rebecca West’s book were read for me yesterday but I cannot judge until I hear the whole essay. I think that P.P. had in her case the intended effect of blowing up some bogey bogus personality and that she is quite delighted with the explosion. It is a pity that W.L. did not wait for its publication too as it would probably have much mollified his attack. By the way, have you not received any press cuttings lately about his book and can you tell me how many more books he has published since I left Paris a few months ago? There seems to be a mention of me every week in the New Statesman. The Irish Statesman, which you don’t get, had an article about T-13 and some correspondence. Buck Mulligan fell out of an aeroplane with or after or before a Lady Martin. One may joke a little about it because fortunately neither the air man nor the airmaid seem to be any the worse. In fact they fell into a very shallow sea and I suppose are now merman and mermaid. The story seems rather curious but there is a comic poem about it in a Galway paper and the information comes from an allusion in a letter from my mother-in-law whose method of writing is often as cryptic as my own. The plane must have been very low but I am glad that they are both uninjured. I have probably forgotten several things I wanted to say. I had no iritis of the eyes but the thing I told you, proceeding from outward infection it seems but it is very bothering and troublesome, and I have to go to the clinic every morning. Mrs. Bécat is making [a] wonderful carpet for me representing the [Liffey] flowing through Dublin into the Irish Sea with the arms of Norway; Dublin; Ireland and my own all woven into the scheme. There is a case pending in Germany and Switzerland between Rasher of Zurich (I wish somebody would make bacon of him for he is an impossible escroc) and the Rheinverlag but I need not weary you about that nor with an account of my holidays. What are your plans for the Autumn and Winter? If my eyes do not get better to allow me to work (and what joy there will be in some quarters if they do not) I thought it would be useless for me to stay in Paris doing nothing and that I would go to Torquay but I am always making imaginary journeys. The complete eclipse of my seeing faculties so kindly predicted by A.M.’s young friend from Oxford, the ghost of Banquet [sic], I am warding off by dressing in the three colors of successive stages of cecity as the Germans divide them; namely, green Starr; that is, green blindness, or glaucoma; grey Starr; that is, cataract, and black star, that is dissolution of the retina. This therefore forms a nocturnal tri-color connected by one common color; green, with Shaun’s national flag of peas, rice, egg yolk. The grey of evening balancing the gold of morning and the black of something balancing the white of something else, the egg probably. So I had a jacket made in Munich of a green stuff I bought in Salzburg and the moment I got back to Paris I bought a pair of black and grey shoes and a grey shirt; and I had a pair of grey trousers and I found a black tie and I advertised for a pair of green braces and Lucia gave me a grey silk handkerchief and the girl found a black sombrero and that completed the picture. I will now close this letter which I ought to have written long ago. It was rather amusing to dictate it because my mind has been a stupid blank for weeks and I have the vapors; or the languors or something of that kind. So I hope it will amuse you though I really am not in such good humor as you might suppose from the few damp squibs of humor contained herein. Just one paragraph more: What about Miss Marsden’s book? Is it coming out this year or any part of it? I am glad you have had good weather but a more boring summer I never passed; with one heat wave after another in Central Europe. Pound’s book of Cantos is out, a most magnificent thing in gold and scarlet at prices ranging from five to fifty pounds. Antheil wrote to me he was coming to Salzburg to see Otto Kahn (who by the way must have most of his time taken up dodging people who want to see him for one purpose only) but he did not come. He writes that the Cologne opera affair at which we are supposed to assist from the Royal Box is a sure thing and that he has some splendid proposals from one of the three greatest publishing combines in Europe. With kindest regards; sincerely yours, James Joyce",
