  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards, I return you today the MS of Dubliners which you suggested in your letter of 19 June that I should alter at certain points. I have read it carefully from beginning to end and have made the following alterations: I have rewritten the first story in the book The Sisters and included the last story A Little Cloud which you asked me to send on with the others. I have corrected a few small errors and re-arranged and renumbered the stories in the middle of the book, so that the book should now consist of fourteen stories in the order in which I have placed them I have deleted the word ‘bloody’ in six places, namely, on page 4 of Two Gallants, on page 7 and twice on page 16 of Ivy Day in the Committee-Room, and twice on page 16 of Grace. I have deleted the passage you objected to in Counterparts and have rewritten the incident in the way I engaged to do. I will not conceal from you that I think I have injured these stories by these deletions but I sincerely trust you will recognise that I have tried to meet your wishes and scruples fairly. And I will ask you to write to me, as soon as possible after receipt of the MS, in order that I may know definitely what you intend to do. This address will find me until the 28th July. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
