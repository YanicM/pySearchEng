  "text": "Dear Miss Beach: Am not very well so am scribbling this lying down—intestinal attack, and heaviness in eyes. Please send all Rheinverlag, Frankfurter Z Brody or Goll letters you may still have bearing on case at once to Monro Saw & Co, 44 Queen Victoria Street, London EC. I also want 3 copies each of C. Trib and Intrans, copies of which shd also be sent to Boraci), Brody Goll and Curtius. You may mention Faber & Faber since it is out and the Viking but do not give my solicitor names without their permission. At what price will you remainder Exag and how many copies have you? Those Japs have been translating essays galore, it seems, without asking leave or paying, out of Exag and everywhere. So I had Hiteshi Ito’s article on me translated into English today and it will probably appear in English in some review here. Ito will be paid, less Pinker’s fee and cost of translation, but I want the assent of the two Japs in writing to this as a preliminary to negotiations over Ulysses. Will write to L.G, after I have seen G.M. on Sunday. If the F.R has not printed S.G.’s article yet telephone him to ask it back. F & F have asked me scores of times about Gorman, where he is, what he is doing, whether he has abandoned the book or not, if I had seen any of it and whether it has my sanction and if they could see some of it. I said I knew nothing, that he had collected some material, that I had never seen a page of the book itself and that I heard he had laid the book aside temporarily and I supposed, was going back to U.S.A. Sincerely yours J.J.",
