  "text": "Dear Budgen: The above is our address. We are here near Lucia. Glad to know Mrs Budgen and Joan are in Berks and hope you are too by now. But probably you are not. Sorry the Fortnightly declined your article no sense of business the Nineteenth Century had one 6 months before. I suppose you have tried another review—there is an article in the Revue de Paris (1 Sept) which your public library [should have]. You seem still surprised about the Sunday Times. Léon heard a long time ago that this paper had declared its intention to ignore the book on publication as ‘irrelevant to literature’. A little coaxing may change that, however. With friendly greetings cordialement votre James Joyce",
