  "text": "My darling It is now nearly two in the morning. My hands are shivering with cold for I have had to go out to bring home my sisters from a party: and now I must walk down to the G.P.O. But I do not want my love to be without her letter in the morning. The ornament I had made expressly for you is now safe in my pocket. I show it to everyone so that everyone may know I love you, Nora dear, and think of you, darling, and wish to honour you. I was singing an hour ago your song The Lass of Aughrim. The tears come into my eyes and my voice trembles with emotion when I sing that lovely air. It was worth coming to Ireland to have got it from your poor kind motherâ€”of whom I am very fond, Nora dear. It is perhaps in art, Nora dearest, that you and I will find a solace for our own love. I would wish you to be surrounded by everything that is fine and beautiful and noble in art. You are not, as you say, a poor uneducated girl. You are my bride, darling, and all I can give you of pleasure and joy in this life I wish to give you. Nora darling, let our love as it is now never end. You understand now your strange erring wilful jealous lover, do you not, dearest? You will try to hold him in all his wandering moods, will you not, dearest? He loves you, believe that always. He has never had a particle of love for anyone but you. It is you who have opened a deep chasm in his life. Every coarse word in speech offends me now for I feel that it would offend you. When I was courtingyou (and you were only nineteen, darling, how I love to think of that!) it was the same. You have been to my young manhood what the idea of the Blessed Virgin was to my boyhood. O tell me, my sweet love, that you are satisfied with me now. One word of praise from you fills me with joy, a soft rose-like joy. Our children (much as I love them) must not come between us. If they are good and noble-natured it is because of us, dear. We met and joined our bodies and souls freely and nobly and our children are the fruit of our bodies. Good night, my dearest girl, my little Galway bride, my tender love from Ireland. How I would love to surprise you sleeping now! There is a place I would like to kiss you now, a strange place, Nora. Not on the lips, Nora. Do you know where? Good night, beloved! Jim",
