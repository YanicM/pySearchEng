  "text": "Dear Mr Mechin: I am glad to know that you have received your copy of Ulysses safely and that your manuscript of the music on pp. 643–644 has been decently reproduced. It was very kind of you to take all that trouble and to have endured so patiently the hearing of Molly Bloom’s characteristic songs qui ne sont plus dans le mouvement. I hope the reading may relieve in some measure the monotony of your life down there. With renewed thanks Sincerely yours James Joyce",
