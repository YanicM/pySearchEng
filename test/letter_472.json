  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Will you please apply to my London publisher for the corrected proofs of my play Exiles with my MS corrections and hand them on to Messrs Slack, Monro Saw and Co, solicitors, 70 Queen Street, London E.C.4 for their client to whom I present them. I shall also be very grateful to you if you will wire me to let me know whether my New York publisher has sent any money for me. If so and if not already dispatched kindly wire the amount to me at above address or to the Banca Svizzera-Americana (Swiss-American Bank), Locarno. If he has not kindly cable him at once to cable you amount due or advance thereon. My health is much better and my sight improving here but my stay here depends on my receiving this money as soon as possible. I hope to be able to resume work on my book Ulysses next week. With many thanks Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Of course all cable and telegraphic expenses are to my charge. J.J.",
