  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I hope this reaches you in time to wish you a happy New Year. We got over Christmas well enough in spite of my occluded eye. Since Saturday there is (I am almost afraid to say it) a small, but definite return of some kind of vision in my eye. Dr Borsch says it has been a great battle but apparently he thinks it is over. I can make out objects dimly even without a lens. Of course I must have one to replace that extracted and another to correct my sight. Well, I hope. There is some mixed news. The princess sent me a cheque [for] 825 francs when I was in the clinique for the piece in Commerce. I endorsed it to Mr Morel who wants it. There was a meeting of editors. V.L. offered his hand to L.P.F. In presence of all John Henry Fargue turned his back and walked away over the asphodel fields. The princess wept on L.P.F.’s new overcoat who then wrote to V.L. three times, comme ça: Odysseus, you have treated me badly. V.L. replied: My dear Achilles etc etc. So now they meet. The Anglo-American review seems important. There is a strong attack on me in Les Marges but temperate towards me personally. A book of parodies from Dublin of AE, WBY etc even inserts a note before the parody of me, apologising for ‘this poor attempt’ etc. I am sorry to see that Mr William Archer is dead. He was very kind to me at one time. I am afraid he forgot it and me. I suppose you are having the usual deluge. The weather is against me. For some reason or other I am dreadfully tired. Fatigue, fatigue, fatigue. I suppose it will pass soon. Perhaps it is Ulysses or 2 years and 8 months of eye worry or four operations so soon after one another or 600 drops of iodine and as many more of scopolamine in about a month. I hope the new year brings us all health and a glimpse of the sun. With kindest regards and renewed good wishes from myself and all this household sincerely yours James Joyce",
