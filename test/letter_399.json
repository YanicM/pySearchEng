  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: The editor of The Egoist writes proposing to publish my novel, subject to the approval of the staff and publishing company. I have replied asking her to telephone to you. Perhaps you can see her. She has also sent me the address of their Paris correspondent but thinks that publication there would be difficult and unsatisfactory. I agree to this proposal if you do. I dislike the prospect of waiting another nine years before my next book appears—with the result which you know. All these schemes can be worked simultaneously one against the other, can they not? In any case Miss Weaver’s proposal is most friendly and I beg you to consider it.",
