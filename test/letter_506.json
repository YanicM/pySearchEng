  "text": "Dear Sir: I was given your address at the Italian library here. Having seen your Italian translations of the works of two friends of mine—Synge and Yeats, The Playboy of the Western World and The Countess Cathleen—I thought you might be interested in my novel. Enclosed you will find a few somewhat polyglot criticisms. At all events I have asked the publishers in London to send you a copy and it will arrive, I hope, at the gods’ pleasure. I am sorry to confess that I am not acquainted with your own works although I keep myself well informed about the latest literary movements. But the fact that you have chosen Synge and Yeats to introduce them to Italian readers rather than the dull novels which the English public devours gives me confidence. May I beg you to let me know whether you have already received the copy sent to your address?",
