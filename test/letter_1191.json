  "text": "Dear McAlmon: Yes, we are still at this address. I got back from Zurich ten days ago and luckily operation no 11 (world’s amateur championship) has been staved off till the autumn. I did not receive a copy of the drawing from Hiler but unless it is much heavier in line I shall make nothing of it. I cannot see at all the lines of the sanguine John did of me. My sight is very embarrassing for nobody, for instance, looking at the handwriting of this letter will believe that I do not see like others. It is useless to explain. One must have gone through the hoop oneself. Probably you did not recognise Budgen because he is now cleanshaven but it surprises me that his painter’s eye did not recognise you. You should be on your guard about agents. They are very unsatisfactory except for the handling of commercial ‘copy’. I am glad you like London. I suppose it is better but D.O.R.A. is still to the fore. And she is a B.O.R.E.",
