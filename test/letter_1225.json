  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: On receipt of the news from London I told Léon to break off my contracts with Pinker and Lane as I really could not stand one of those interminable correspondences. What he wrote I don’t know but now after some more weeks consultations of process-servers and policewomen Messrs. L. write saying that they will print and publish at once and that nothing on earth will prevent them from publishing what 12 years ago nothing on earth would have induced them to publish. I trust that the slow but steady advance of our depleted forces in this sector meets with Your Highness’s approval. Léon managed to get leave from the French to come here for 3 days … here is a letter from Lucia…. The little hotel she speaks of in the P.S. is the place where we passed our honeymoon…. It seems to me that the attempts made by more than one person to poison her mind against me have failed and that I am in such a position that whether I go or stay I shall be blamed as the culprit. Maybe I am an idiot but I attach the greatest importance to what Lucia says when she is talking about herself. Her intuitions are amazing. The people who have warped her kind and gentle nature are themselves failures and if they smile at her remarks as those of a spoilt bourgeoise child it is because they are stupid failures into the bargain. My wife and I have seen hundreds of examples of her clairvoyance. Of course I don’t mean the juggling variety. But today we had a more than usually striking example. Some weeks ago she asked me to write to my sister Eileen, the one you met in London. I said I would write to my sister Eva to find out. A reply came from the latter dissuading Lucia from the plan of having her aunt Eileen come over here to stay with her. Dr Brunner (in whose sanatorium she is) came here to lunch. I met him after for coffee, told him of the reply and said I thought it would be well to show it to Lucia who even talked of going to Dublin, as it was shown by the reply that her aunt Eileen was not any more in Dublin but (to my great surprise) living at a rather bleak and cheap place on the Wicklow coast, called Bray (pleasant enough in summer) and that the general atmosphere of her family was not suitable. I said I believed the letter would make Lucia less [? discontented] where she was. He agreed. I handed him the letter which I had in my pocket. A week passed. Now here is a bit of our conversation with Lucia last Friday. (She had asked me if Eva had replied at our last visit and I said yes and that I had given the letter to Dr Brunner who would give it to her.) Lucia, turning to me abruptly: So it was all an invention of yours about Eva’s letter? I: No. I always tell you the truth. Did Dr Brunner not give you the letter? Lucia: No. I: He forgot it then. I’ll ring him up. Lucia: He is a bit gaga like all his psychiatries. Eileen is a bit loony. So am I, they say. I think it would do me good to be with her, keeping house. Not necessarily in Dublin. In Bray, say. It must be very pretty in Bray. I: Yes. In summer. After the visit and we had come back to Zurich. My wife: Lucia must be either lying to us. Dr B. must have given her the letter. Or she does not know what she is saying. How else could she know Eileen is in Bray? Nobody ever spoke to Lucia of Bray. She can scarcely have known that such a place exists. I: I wonder is it possible she divined it without having seen the letter. B. can hardly be so forgetful as not have thought of it in ten days, however. This morning on the Telephone. I: Will you please send me back the letter from my sister I gave you if my daughter has already seen it as I want it myself to reply to? Dr B.: You didn’t give me any letter from your sister. You gave me a copy of prof. Naeggeli’s opinion which I did not show her as it would upset her. I: So she hasn’t seen the letter. Dr B.: Not from me unless you showed it to her or left it here by mistake. Do you know where it is? I: No. I thought you had it. Dr B.: Probably it is in your pocketbook from where you took N’s opinion unless you left it out here and she saw it. I searched my pocket book. No trace of the letter but an hour ago after a long search found it under a pile of correspondence in a drawer in this room in the hotel…. Excuse scrawl. Am writing with a fountain pen, lying on a bed. We don’t want to write But, by Jingo, when we do.",
