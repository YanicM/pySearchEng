Though I was partly smothered by a cold and in a state of exhaustion it seems to have made an impression for the next day also I received letters and bouquets! I performed a firstclass collapse for a day and a half which I repeated on Saturday but today am feeling quite well again. I hope you will like it. I think it will make a good opening. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
