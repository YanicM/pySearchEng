I intended to go on Tuesday next as the weather here is very bad and I need a rest between one operation and [another] operation. I am here with my family. I hope you will forgive me for not having written to you before. I shall explain to you the reason when I have the pleasure of meeting you. Allow me in the meantime to express my very grateful thanks. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
