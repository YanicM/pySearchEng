  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver Thanks for the advance (£120). I took a flat on Wednesday and payed luckily only a small sum (£2) as I had not the money in my pocket. An hour afterwards I felt the first sign of trouble in my eye and the following day I was again in the doctor’s hands, one recommended to me by Dr Borsch in case of need. He attributes the relapse chiefly to the rain and wind-storms of the past week. It had not rained for nine months before my arrival. I am to have the visit of five leeches in an hour from now and he hopes that by relieving the congestion the attack will not develop. There is no tension. He thinks that as soon as practicable I ought to be operated as the risk is too great. My sight has improved very much even during the inflammation. By raising my head to a certain angle I can see as well through the bad eye as through the good. This means that there is a clear space in the lower part of the nebula on the lens. It seems the operation is not likely to have as damaging an effect as if it had been made when the sight was almost totally effaced. Will you please confirm your instructions which I sent to Mr Darantiere. I now close this letter as my daughter who is writing it is not such a distinguished english writer as her troublesome father, thank God. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Job Joyce",
