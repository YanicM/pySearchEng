  "text": "Dearest Nora I have been in such a glow of pleasure since last night that I am quite restless today. I want to hear you say it a hundred times. How can you think I do not appreciate anything? Perhaps it is because my manner is so cheerful. My life has made me very reserved in what I say but you must not be disheartened by that. I dreamed of you last night. What is the good of my writing this stupid letter. I want simply to be beside you. I expect to see my brother in an hour or so to find out. Just this moment I have received a letter I was expecting but I shall not know definitely for a few days. Tonight 8.30. Jim",
