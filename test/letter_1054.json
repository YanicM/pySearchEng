  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: This holy Saturday ceremony began at 8 a.m. and ended at 2 p.m. These few lines are just to let you know our address. I had a bad night but think I am beginning to feel somewhat rested. I hope your crossing was a smooth one. It is useless to discuss my present condition with Miss Beach. As she does not know what my motive is [a blot here] (That was the hotel pen that interrupted) she naturally regards my acts in a wrong light and has no idea of what I have to face in the way of expenses over there. I shall think the matter over more carefully as regards dates as soon as we or rather my wife is rested and I am better. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
