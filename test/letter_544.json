  "text": "Dear Budgen: I enclose two letters, underlining two significant passages. As regards the letter from S. if you are manager of the E.P. at present the only message I wish you to convey is one of my regret for the constant trouble he encounters, which I hope he will succeed in overcoming. Personally, however, I cannot attend to this matter in the present disturbed state of my domestic economy. I wrote twice to the secretary of the authors’ union. They don’t want letters. They want cash. So do I and badly. I may say that if I had in my pocket the money I gave the E.P. lately—about 10,000 lire at present exchange I should be better off. This for yourself, however. I beg you to give my regards to Mrs S. and Mr S. with apologies for my silence—understandable in present circumstances. I hope he will write no more petulant letters to me who am in no way to blame. As regards X. he seems to be threatening libel proceedings by his letter in which case yourself, Hummel and I will be led forth shackled ‘for they were malefactors’. Since I came here I wrote a long letter to Mrs M. asking her very urgently to consider the advisability of the revivability of her aid. That distinguished lady never answered. X. pretends he never knew my address here—another piece of fooling. He forgets only what he dislikes to remember, viz., that he promised me as a gift Doktor Jung Wandlungen der Libido (prolonged universal applause, shouts Hear Hear from a raughty tinker and an Irishman in the gallery). For God’s sake give those louts the go by. As for the Garryowen poetic lectures I am glad I was not there. Pound wrote ‘enthusing’ about the Cyclops episode…. Miss W. writes saying that after a perusal of it she found it hard to keep from interlarding her speech with I’s favourite adjective. By the way did you get the sealed packet, the bottle of wine, etc. There are in Mr Owen’s room about 40 or 50 copies of Verbannte. Could you remove them to your studio and sell them (for yourself I mean) whenever anyone comes in and drinks my health in Her Most Excellent Excellency’s the Archduchess’s most excellent piss (Pardon! Fendant de Valais). Only please keep 10 copies of the stage edition and 5 of the other. Also if Mrs M. doesn’t reply within a month I shall take the MS back. No chance of a flat here. The town is full of rumours of my success (financial chiefly) in foreign parts so that I avoid all contact with people. Need I tell you what a great privation it is to me to have not here within earshot your over-patient and friendly self? I hope you will let me know in advance what you intend to do, if staying there or moving south. I have not written a word of Nausikaa beyond notation of flapper’s atrocities and general plan of the specially new fizzing style (Patent No 7728SP.ZP.BP.LP.). My regards to Paul Suter and D. Hummel. Next time I shall send you a letter for Miss Herter. Your pictures have now reached Chiasso only! Seemingly they are being admired en route. Please write me as soon as possible. It is quite easy as I find if you once sit down. How are you progressing artistically? This letter is full of materiality. So am I, alas!",
