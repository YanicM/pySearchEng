  "text": "Dear Helen: As you are probably not yet quite recovered from the shock of having received a letter from my wife, I shall be brief and spare you. This is to wish you many happy returns of your birthday. There is a difference of opinion between my wife and myself as to the date. She thinks it is the 17 or 19, I that it is the 16. Perhaps like S. Patrick you have two of them: 8 + 9 = 17. By the way I see that a cent per cent American with a 2000% Polish mama is to introduce a bill making 17 March a legal holiday over there. I do hope the poor Chinese will not be left out of the next procession. Every good chink should wear the shamrock for Sir Patlick…. Apart from your own lucky existence depressing stories reach me of the state of the national purse. Stephens says Universities which used to pay him 600 and 700 $ pay now only 15 $. And Cerf sent over some royalties which were about ¼ of what Léon had been led to reckon on and then there is a bagatelle of 40,000 frs owed to Lucia and myself for the Mime…. Spring with all her chickens is upon us and before I go down to Léon I must put on a lighter vest. Budgen was here and my wife commissioned him to do a mural for her salon of London river (such, mes 8 enfants, is the manner in which the able bodied seaman alludes to what me and you call the Thames). We also had a big teaparty here on Sunday and all your portraits were admired by everybody the whole time….",
