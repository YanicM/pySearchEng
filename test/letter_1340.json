  "text": "Dear Curran: Herbert Gorman whom you met at Fontainebleau is leaving for Dublin where he will stay a couple of weeks, at the Royal Hibernian Hotel, Dawson Street. As you know he is writing a life of me. He has letters from certain writers there but I am giving him this one to you. Perhaps you can show him some places, Chapelizod, Howth (if the rhododendrums are in bloom) and Clongowes Wood: that is to say if you still have your car. If not, perhaps he could go by bus. I am sure you will help him. Curiously enough, another friend of mine (who, I think is also doing a book about me) has gone to Dublin. In fact just as I sat down to write this a wire came from him to say he had arrived in Dublin two days before he had planned to get there. He has just delivered a lecture about me before the Italian Club here and he is giving two lectures in Dublin at one or other of the universities. He is Louis Gillet. He wrote the preface for Lucia’s book. He is a son-in-law of René Doumic, editor of the Revue des Deux Mondes and perpetual secretary of the Academy, brother-in-law of the late Henri de Regnier and nephew of the late, the more than late José-Maria Heredia. I think he is staying at the French Legation in Dublin. To return to Gorman. He also wants to be present at the first (and last?) performance of my first (and last?) play in Dublin. It has already made spectral appearances on the boards at Munich, Milan, Berlin, New York and London. A child appears in the last act about 10.30 and I am not sure whether this will be allowed. Anyhow please present the bouquets to the two actresses whoever they are. (Gorman asked me where my sister lives or rather my sisters. I told him that I don’t know. And I might have said more. I have not told him any details of my daughter’s sojourn in Ireland. The poor girl still speaks of it as if she had been in Tirnan-Ogue. But this is not due to any mistrust on my part but rather because after five or six years I find it useless to try to explain the case to anybody any more. From what I can discern everybody has one way or another made up his or her mind. Those who are not mystified are bored and those who are not bored are more pleased than sorry. I think that if the mysterious malady which has attacked her youth has not laid her out before now and if the green isle of Erin let her escape alive I still hope.) Our friendly regards to Mrs Curran and your daughter sincerely yours James Joyce.",
