  "text": "Dear Budgen: I sent you today Matisse’s drawings. Will you and Sargent please look at them and tell me what you think of them? And send them back for I have to return them. I simply cannot write letters. We have been here in Z’ch 3 months. Näggeli is stumped: can make nothing of the case physically. Psychically she is supposed to be in the hands of Jung. If anything lies ahead of us except ruin I wish someone would point it out. The few friends we have leave Z’ch on the 22 so we shall pass our 30th Xmas together alone or 31st rather. The doctors say: go away. When we try to go she throws a fit or something and so we hang on. Giorgio and Helen are still in N.Y. I am trying to write something for the next number of transition. You can imagine how easy it is. We saw the Fleiners a few times—a very charming old couple. I told him I got the idea of the technique of the newest fragment from one of his lectures I was at. I won the final appeal in the U.S. Schluss. I hope Sargent is better and the weather too. Give him and Mrs Sargent our kindest remembrances. And I hope you yourself are enjoying the very best of health and Mrs Budgen. As for us we are two poor Godforsaken gipsies on the roadside. A happy Xmas nevertheless to all of you Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Perhaps you could send a line to Lucia. She never gets a letter. Sanatorium Dr Brunner, Kusnacht, bei Z’ch. We have a friend in Vence to whom you could give our news and regards. His name is Bruce, Villa des Chardons. Scotch of course. I hope he is well.",
