  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: I hope Lady Carlow and yourself enjoyed your trip round the North. I have been (unsuccessfully) dodging thunderstorms along the Rhine valley. We return to France tomorrow and to Paris in a week or so. Should I still be away when you come please ring up my friend Paul Léon. Mr Louis Golding did not call me up or write. I forget whether it is mentioned on the title page that the lettrine is by my daughter? Is it? I have been working altogether too much at my book, now in its final stages. I wish it were in its final-final. I have been trying to spin out the days until the first performance here of your operatic namesake, Verdi’s Don Carlo but it is still ten days off. And we have had our fill of thunder-laden, lightning-furrowed Mitteleuropa’s schöne Sommerzeit. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
