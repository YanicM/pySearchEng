  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: On calling at Miss Beach’s the other morning I got your letter of the 9 instant with its bad news. You say you are going to Guildford today so I hope you may receive this on arrival there. I am much distressed to hear of your brother’s death in such a way. Surely, though a doctor, he must have neglected or misunderstood his case. It seems to me to have been similar to Wallace’s whose life, I am sure, was saved by a timely operation last spring. It is very shocking to think of. You do not say whether the niece you speak of is his daughter or not. You will have a very gloomy return to your sister. I hope her case will not be aggravated by the death of her brother and that your family will be spared any of these dreadful troubles for a long time to come. In these circumstances I shall not weary you with news and articles and gossip. I set to work at once on what you told me and shall go on. I know it is no more than a game but it is a game that I have learned to play in my own way. Children may just as well play as not. The ogre will come in any case. With my sympathy to you and your family and my kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
