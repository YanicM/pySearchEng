  "text": "Dear Budgen: I hope you are alive, well and sold something in Basel. Your pictures came all right and are up. Machine arrived broken, books safe, total cost about 600 francs. The situation here highly unpleasant. No flat or sign of one. I have refused lessons up to the present but have been appointed to the school again—it is now a commercial university—one hour a day. For six weeks after my arrival I neither read nor wrote nor spoke, but as it cannot go on so I started Nausikaa and I have written less than half. Perhaps I can finish it for Feb. 2nd. No reply from Mrs M. It seems that gentility cannot be acquired in a single generation…. I heard nothing from Sykes or the English foulplayers, but people tell me they still perform. Linotti was here twice smelling around—God knows for what. X I met on New Year’s day in the street. He approached smiling (I suppose at my ridiculous get-up) and saluted. I replied. We now cook for ourselves in this household. Till yesterday I was paying 35 lire a day to my brother-in-law. Now I pay him half rent gas coal and we pig for ourselves. Golly! Apart from this is the damnable boredom. Not a soul to talk to about Bloom. Lent two chapters to one or two people but they know as much about it as the parliamentary side of my arse. My brother [knows] something but he thinks it a joke, besides he was four years in internment, has a devil of a lot to do and likes a gay elegant life in his own set. O shite and onions! When is this bloody state of affairs going to end? Have you the copies of Verbannte? If so sell them to anybody will take ’em and keep the cash for yourself. I suppose P.S. is now married. Give him my best wishes. Are you staying on in Zurich? Is there any God’s chance of your coming here for a week? I doubt if I can raise the whole lot. I could put you up however for that length of time and feed but there is the bloody fare. I might be able to go halves in it. Perhaps next month? Nausikaa will be finished, I hope. To abandon the book now would be madness. First half of Cyclops appeared in November with excision of the erection allusion. Do you ever see S. Lang? I wish he would send me back registered my novel. The copy is not mine but dedicated. On receipt of this approach an inkbottle with intention. I know it is a bore but I should like to hear your views and plans. By the way do you or did you know any Weavers in St Ives? I ask because Miss W. sent me a snapshot taken there. Verbannte appears to have gone under in Germany. Writing Ulysses is a tough job enough without all this trouble. The prospect of starting lessons again next month is damn unpleasant. Winter here is mild enough and will soon be over. Plenty of good opera but I never go. (Can’t because somebody either pawned or sold my dress suit and it costs 600 lire to buy one.) Perhaps if I had my own flat it might not be so bad. (I may remark that the greater part of the furniture here is mine.) Doing any kind of business upsets me. Schlie (Mrs Piazza’s man) is here—a decent sort of fellow—not a psychoanalyst. Had a card from Ruggiero. Thank him if you see him. I wish you a happy new year and hope to see you soon. As for travelling, being ex-British consul, you should find no difficulties, I suppose, but I daresay I am selfish as usual in suggesting such a troublesome and, to you, unprofitable move. In any case please write by return. Nausikaa is written in a namby-pamby jammy marmalady drawersy (alto l…!) style with effects of incense, mariolatry, masturbation, stewed cockles, painter’s palette, chit chat, circumlocution, etc., etc. Not so long as the others.",
