  "text": "Dear Stannie About Russell: I have written to my printer in Dublin and am to release my ‘Holy Office’ in a week. I shall send the money order to you with a list of addresses. You can deliver many in person. But first of all I hope you have gone to the ‘Homestead’ and found out if he will pay me now for a new story ‘Xmas Eve.’ Kindly send me on a copy of the ‘Speaker’, which contains my last poem and also a copy of the no which contains my other poem. Also send me address of ‘Harper’s’ and of ‘Westminster Gazette’. If you can send a copy or so of the latter so much the better. I have heard from Symons that Grant Richards has become bankrupt for an immense amount of money and consequently I have written for the return of the MS. No key arrived with B A certificate. By the way you might send on the others. Tell Aunt Josephine to let me know her address. I am fairly fixed here £2 a week for sixteen hours weekly. I have not written much of the novel—only the end of the 11th [sic] chapter in Zürich. I have written about half of ‘Xmas Eve’ and about five long pages of ‘Esthetic Philosophy’. I am at present reading some Italian translations of Lassalle but it is difficult to get to the bottom of a science like political science through pamphlets of too vivid actuality. I think then that after a short course in Aristotle I will shut up the books and examine for myself in a cafe. By the way Nora makes my cigarettes for me by machine: 70 of good Turkish tobacco cost me about 8d. She is still very well and wishes to be remembered to you. She is however interested to know what went on in the Hotel. Do you know nothing? As for the comments of ‘Irish Ireland’—she seems to have as high an opinion of them as I have. She wonders how you can live at home and often asks me to help you to go abroad. I have read Moore’s ‘Untilled Field’ in Tauchnitz. Damned stupid. A woman alludes to her husband in the confession-box as ‘Ned’. Ned thinks &c! A lady who has been living for three years on the line between Bray and Dublin is told by her husband that there is a meeting in Dublin at which he must be present. She looks up the table to see the hours of the trains. This on DW and WR where the trains go regularly: this after three years. Isn’t it rather stupid of Moore. And the punctuation! Madonna! I am going to buy Henry James’s ‘Madonna of the Future’ today. I am afraid I cannot finish my novel for a long time. I am discontented with a great deal of it and yet how is Stephen’s nature to be expressed otherwise. Eh? I am getting rather stout and mannish. I really can’t write. Nora is trying on a pair of drawers at the wardrobe Excuse me Jim",
