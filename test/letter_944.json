  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: The reading seems to have made a profound impression on the audience (about 25 people of the world’s 1500 million) but I have been literally doubled in two from fatigue and cramp ever since—in which plight I am also now. I was much better this morning but began to work again this afternoon…. t.8 has not yet arrived. I read from an advance copy. But from your letter I think you will not be in the mood to read it yet. There is an article in it by a schoolfriend of Pound’s to whom the latter had written, he tells me, denouncing my book as ‘backwash’ and urging him to have nothing to say to it. The article is an unexpected reply. Pound wrote to me a letter about a phrase or expression used, he alleges, by scholastics. I don’t know what he means or what it means as he quotes it. A great number of Irishmen have been ringing my doorbell lately. I am not quite sure what they are all after. I have not had time to think it out on account of Mrs A.L. It is agreeable to me to think you are back for a few days in Greenhalldoor Palace. I wish I was in Euston Castle, putting pomade on my hair to go to see the Drury Lane pantomime of the ovular ogre who sat on a wall etc. As I am not feeling well I will give up trying to be funny for the spasmodic moment and finish this tomorrow.",
