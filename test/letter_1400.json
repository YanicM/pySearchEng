  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: Many thanks for your letters and the welcome enclosures. I am glad that you rejoice to have an heir to follow you up and also that my longsought song turned up so opportunely after so many years. I sent the music on to my son as it needs a deep strong voice, not my tenore di grazia, to bassoon the close. You, however, as titular chief of that region are the one who should sing it and with that ambassadorial wand of office brandished high in your right hand. The allusions so far in my book to Portarlington and Carlow have been of such a drearily commestible kind—scallions, meat and so on—that I shall have to find a place to suggest this ferocious and exciting song. I hope all your little storiellas have been safely disposed of by now and are off the market for their mighty mother is now at last making ready to take her slide into the unsuspecting sea. I am making a brief holiday here but return to Paris in a few days to hammer on the last plates and paint her title before the skippereeen father gives her his blessing. I do not know who Mr Barzun is but have asked my friend E Jolas about him. And I wonder is the Mrs Betty Byrne alluded to in your letter a namesake only of the Betty Byrne alluded to on the first page of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. That worthy lady herself would be about 140 years of age now. I thank her good sense for she introduced me to sweets for which, contradictory as it may seem, I have almost as fervent a feeling as I have for the delightful white wine of this and the next cantons. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
