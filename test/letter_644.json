  "text": "Dear Mr Sykes: Many thanks for your kind letter. Quinn has had the pages photographed (as he won’t send back the ms) and is sending on the result so that I shall not need to trouble you. Valery Larbaud, the French novelist and translator of Samuel Butler, who is raving about Ulysses has given us a charming furnished flat for the summer (rue Cardinal Lemoine 7, Paris VI) whither we shall move (O merde! que ça m’embête) on the 2 or 3 of June. Giorgio … leaves for Zurich on 1 June for a month. You can return the typescript here registered if sending by return. Otherwise better send it c/o Shakespeare and Co, rue Dupuytren 8, Paris VI. I heard today that Mr Philip Carr (absit omen!) is a great admirer of Exiles and wants to play it here in English. He is founding or refounding or confounding an English Theatre in Paris. I am glad you liked Circe and Eumeus. Struggling with the acidities of Ithaca—a mathematico-astronomico-physico-mechanico-geometrico-chemico sublimation of Bloom and Stephen (devil take ’em both) to prepare for the final amplitudinously curvilinear episode Penelope.",
