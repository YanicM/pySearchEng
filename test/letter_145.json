  "text": "Dear Stannie Got your letter today. You are really a mumchance—living on bread and ham. Listen. Go at once to Artifoni and tell him it is a matter of urgent necessity for you to get a week’s pay in advance—and you’ll get it. Keep 10 crowns yourself and telegraph 20 to me. Go to Effore or to Fantini or to Canarutto—eat anyway. Tell A you can’t give lessons without food, that you are a year in his service and have never asked for any advance and that you gave back the 30 crowns he gave me. Anyway I think it would be folly to ruin the first chance I have got of ameliorating our position. And what can I do? At a pinch I could raise money but I could not do it without endangering my position. Let me have, if possible at all, a wire from you on Thurs. morn I answered that advt today but have had no answer yet. Finances: 10 lire! Jim",
