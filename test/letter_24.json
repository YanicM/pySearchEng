I am to go with Mr Casey’s son to visit the Comtesse Vercelli-Rawson next week. Is there any possibility of my paying Mr Casey on Saturday as I promised if the ‘Speaker’ does not send me some money? Can the ‘Express’ be afraid to insert my review of Lady Gregory’s book? Have either of the other reviews gone in? Tell Stannie to look well through the back nos. I could not cash your order today. You must have been late with it. Jim Blackface served up my bill this morning.",
