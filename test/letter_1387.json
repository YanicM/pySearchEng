  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: What must you not think of me? Well, I am nearly exhausted, working literally night and day but I am going to take three or four days of rest if I can switch my addled mind off that accursed book of mine. I received the copies of S.a.s.i.S and they have been greatly admired by all who have seen them. I heard last night that there was a very good notice in the London Star. If you have seen it and know the date please let me know and I shall order two copies. Louis Golding was over here and we had lunch together. I liked him and was sorry he was not free to dine for, as you know, I do not like luncheons. The several accounts you have sent me of your ‘pleasure cruise’ reconcile me to my quiet life in le vieux Paname here. My son returned from New York a few days ago. He sang a few times over Columbia Station during his short stay and, in fact, I had a new wireless set rigged up for the occasion with the aid of an antenna on the balcony made out of one of my many walking sticks—not the ambassadorial Irish blackthorn—and we heard him singing across the ocean as clearly as if he had been in the next room. I am asking my friend Eugene Jolas to send you a copy of the last issue of transition which contains a fragment of W i P. I am offering prizes of 5/– 2/6 and 1/3 for the three best solutions but am not competing myself as I do not think I am at present capable of winning even the fourth prize of 7½d. Since you are now one of my publishers I shall ask Paul Léon to send you a copy of Europe. There is a long article on me in it which I have not read but I learn that the last ten pages on W i P are very intelligent. Gott sei Dank! My daughter was very delighted with the book too and we both thank you for having given us such a charming thing to have and to hold. With kind regards to Lady Carlow and yourself from us both Sincerely yours James Joyce",
