A friend of mine, one of the translators of U, Stuart Gilbert is a few miles from there. Gasthof Einsiedeln Kitzb√ºhel. He and his wife are coming on here about the 16th. He is writing a commentary on U. Antheil also. His Hero and the Cyclops is to be given at the Cologne Opera in the autumn and we are invited to go. I hope you will visit here. It is worth it. Jim",
