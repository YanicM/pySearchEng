  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedeon: I enclose a letter of Lucia’s (written at a bad time) and I think you ought to add the more recent card you received. Also two lettrines of hers which, of course, should be returned with the letter. Give no indication except that she is a young woman of 27 I met my publisher from the U.S. here and he informed me that the sales now stand at 35,000 but that my compatriot correligionists and the puritan prohibitionists are infuriated and have compelled the state attorney to file an appeal at the eleventh hour. I hope Mr Giedeon and yourself and the children are well. We are back here, resting after our rest. I gave your messages to the Jolases and also to Miss Beach By the way, will you please send me Pulver’s opinion c/o Mr Paul Léon, 27 rue Casimir-Périer, Paris, VII? with the bill, of course. Friendly greetings to you both from my wife and myself. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
