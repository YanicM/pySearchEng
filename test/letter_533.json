Can you inform me when Yeats married? My play will be produced tomorrow night in Munich with one of the best actresses on the German stage in the leading part. I have received a number of telegrams inviting me to be present but nowadays it is difficult to travel anywhere except in a trance. I shall let you know how it gets on. Please write in reply. Jim P.S. Please address clearly: Universitätstrasse [sic] 29.",
