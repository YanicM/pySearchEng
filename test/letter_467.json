  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Thanks for your kind letter and inquiry and also for cheque (137 frs) which I was very glad to receive. I am here by doctor’s advice and hope the dry air will do me good after my rather bad breakdown. Have you received any reply from my New York publisher to whom you wrote in August? I have had none. If not will you please write him express? I corrected yesterday proofs of Exiles. Where is the other typescript copy? Have you sent it to New York or did you submit it to the Pioneer Players or to Miss Horniman’s theatre as you spoke of doing? Is it not possible to do anything with this play? Sincerely yours James Joyce",
