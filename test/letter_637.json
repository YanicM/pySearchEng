  "text": "Dear Mr Palmer: The songs you sent me on Jan 27 were held up by the French Customhouse so that I got [them] only a few hours ago. I don’t know whether M’Cormack got those you sent on 31 Dec. He is in Monte Carlo for the opera season. If he did not get them I shall ask him for a few lines of authorisation and forward them with the others when I have had a copy made for myself. I am sure he will like them. He is an excellent ‘ballad-singer’. I shall write you more in a day or two. Meanwhile thanks for your kind words about my verses. ‘Sleep now’ is in its place at the end of the diminuendo movement and the two last songs are intended to represent the awakening of the mind. ‘O sleep for the winter etc’ means ‘you had better sleep if you can because the winter will try to prevent you if it can’. There is a curious slip in your setting of ‘I hear an army’. I wrote ‘foam about their knees’ not ‘about their lips’. Your preference for this song is shared, I may add, by Yeats. If I can get my affairs in order by June we must try to have your settings of these songs published. Do you know Leigh Henry, the musical critic? Perhaps he could help you. You are interested, it seems, chiefly in my meagre verses. Since Chamber Music I wrote only a dozen songs. Would you care to see them? They are different from the lyrics.",
