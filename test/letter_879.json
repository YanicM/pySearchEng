  "text": "Dear Stannie: We are glad to hear you are coming and will all be very glad to see you again. On receipt of this will you either wire me or send a card to say on what of next week you will probably arrive so that I may make better arrangements than I was able to do in Eileenâ€™s case. The weather is getting better here and Easter is generally very lively here so I think you will enjoy your stay. It is useless to open up any subject touched on in your letter as you are coming personally. Arrivederci Jim",
