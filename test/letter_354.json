  "text": "My dear Mr Pound I am very glad to get your letter of 9 inst and hope that you have now quite recovered from your illness. I have written to Mr Pinker and said that you will interview him. It is very kind of you to offer to do this for me and I shall be guided by you in the matter. The rest of the Portrait of the Artist had better be sent on to Grant Richards as soon as it is ready. As regards rights Mr Grant Richards has the right of refusal of this novel. If he decides not to publish, or rather, if he decides not to conclude the open agreement about it I am quite willing to entrust the disposal of the rights to Mr Pinker. Mr Grant Richards promised last July that he would give a definite answer within three weeks after the completed MS was in his possession. At least it seems to me that he did so but I cannot now find his letter. My comedy Exiles is now finished but I should prefer to hold it over until my novel has been published in book form though I am willing to dispose of it also in the best way. I believe, however, that the letter you send may have a good effect on Grant Richards. If you see Mr Pinker (I mean, of course, as soon as your illness allows you to go out of doors) you will perhaps explain to him why I have delayed in answering his letter and why I am obliged to write in such a roundabout fashion. I must say in conclusion that you are a very good correspondent for you always send me lively and good news. I hope you are living well in these bad times. I am still quite unmolested and hope to remain so but the situation is not very pleasant. I am glad also to hear that The Egoist still continues to appear and beg you to convey my kind regards to the editor whose letter I received and answered some time ago. Very sincerely yours James Joyce",
