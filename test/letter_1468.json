  "text": "Dear Mr Sweeney: I thank you and Mrs Sweeney for your kind cables at Xmas and on my birthday. I hope at least that both occasions were duly observed at your end and that when the worthy celebrant Jolas intoned the ritual ‘Lots of fun’ the prescribed response was full and hearty. Let it so continue. Today is again a birthday, that of my grandson, his eighth. I shall write to Jolas in a day or two…. I have also to confirm Mrs Jolas’s letter from Paris. In fact, as she told you, I wrote to both my N.Y. publishers over 2 months ago but never had a word in reply! With good wishes to you both.",
