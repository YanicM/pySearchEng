  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have received your letter with enclosed cheque for which I thank you very much indeed. You are very kind to send me payment for the serial rights of a book (Ulysses) which is causing you and your paper so much trouble. I have sent the first episode of the Odyssey to Mr Pound but I must apologise for the very bad typescript. I shall try to have the following episodes done better. I hope it is legible in spite of the typist’s mistakes. If you could think of having the paper printed in Paris MM George Crès and Co, 116 Bd. S. Germain have offered to place their printer at your disposal. The copy of the second edition of my novel has arrived as well as the copies you sent to the two local booksellers…. Mr Pinker wrote me some time ago about ceding to you the book rights of Ulysses. I do so gladly. Though I am sure it is in more senses than one a Greek gift. Mr Richards is entitled by contract to a right of refusal which expires on the 15 June 1919. The novel [Ulysses] will hardly have run to its end then and in any case I do not think he would consider it for publication at any time. You may inform my agent that my wish is that you secure the book rights, if you wish, subject to this reservation and that the book is not to be offered to any publisher until you have refused it. I accept in advance any terms you may propose. Moreover, if, in view of the increased price of production, you wish to modify in any way the terms of our existing contract I beg you to notify my agent of the fact. I am glad to note that you are continuing your publications in book form and wish you every success. Allow me to thank you once more for your most generous enterprise and also for the kind words of appreciation of my book. I am very grateful for them.",
