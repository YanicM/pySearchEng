  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: A few lines for today to thank you for your very great kindness to me during my illness. I could not write till a few days ago and then there was the confusion of removal. I do not know whether I shall remain here but in any case you may write to this address. It is useless to bore you with an account of my collapse and the operation. It was difficult but, I hope, successful, though I cannot see very well yet. I enclose receipts which I owe you. If you find them right let me know and I shall remit the balance in your favour. There was some mention of another signed copy of a book but I cannot remember exactly. I suppose you received the 1000 copies of the press notices and also the Marzocco with Mr Angeli’s article. As regards new edition by all means check the proofs yourself but please cancel the headings ‘Chapter I’ etc and put instead the numeral I etc and also the words The End, substituting nothing. Also please transfer the line from Ovid now prefixed to first chapter to a page to itself between titlepage and first page of text. I have arranged, subject to your approval, with Mr Ebell, bookseller, Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich to take 7 copies of the new edition at once on sale or return. MM Crès et Cie, Editions Françaises, Rämistrasse 3, Zurich will also take 7 copies at once. Their manager Mr Trarieux is going to Paris this week and will speak to his firm about a French translation of the book. Till now no notice has appeared in Journal de Genève or Neue Zürcher Zeitung. A daughter of Dostoyevsky’s, however, read the notice in Marzocco and called here yesterday. She wants a copy of the book but I fear she must wait for it. With many thanks and kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
