So you had better send us news all the time. We had to buy winter clothing. I bought a cheap fur overcoat in which I look like the man that stands outside the booth of the bearded lady. We lunch in the vegetarian restaurant and usually dine at the Kronenhalle. Today we lunched in Cerutti’s, and, shocked at my pigeon’s appetite, the girl insisted on my eating a Blutwurst or a Leberwurst. This is about the most exciting thing which has happened to us for some time….",
