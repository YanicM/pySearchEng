  "text": "Dear Stannie I suppose you have too many lessons to write. I sent all kinds of samples to Steiner and hope he may do business on them. I also wrote out a long report on coursing for Sordina. Tell Schmitz I hope to do his business at the end of the week. The advising examiners to the Intermediate have been appointed but the Italian examiner will not be appointed till April. Poppie will be here tomorrow on her way to New Zealand. I have practically arranged with Roberts for the correction of proofs of my stories this month. I understand that certain others of my songs have been set to music by a man in Belfast named Hughes. Pappie’s eyes are bad and he must consult an oculist on Saturday. I have been repeatedly passed by the Sheehys—why? Is Eva getting acclimatised? There is nothing for her to do here. Have you an overcoat? Answer this question. I want you on receipt of these presents to take my crest out of its frame at once and send it to me at once by registered post as the binder is waiting for it. Do not write me details of assets and debts but tell me in a general way if the Trieste branch is above par. You see Charlie is in a bad way. I wish I could do something for him with T.M.K. but cannot in the face of later developments. Tell me how Machnich & Co are satisfied with their agent. Have I not done well for them? I doubt if anyone else could have done better. Coates, the landlord, first gave me a promise of 2 years’ lease. Then he ran it up to 5. Then I pretended to be hot on other premises and brought him down to 3. I wrote yesterday to Vidacovich. Have you seen the letter. Today I wired under instructions of landlord and can do no more. Let them do their part now. I wish you had written telling me your impressions of the affair. I learn there will be elections next spring and that W Fallon B.A. will be M.P. Roger Greene is dead. I hope you go on with Bartoli. Don’t be discouraged by his sleepy manner. He has heard a lot of tenors in his day and that, added to his natural fat, makes him unenthusiastic. I know he will teach you no vices. I see by the papers that the Beri his shule of languages has bobbed up again. How is la Direzione della the Beri his shule? How is Francini getting on? Remember me to Schmitz, be sure. Don’t forget the crest. Write a letter when you can. Chuck exercising and tell Nora I said she was to feed you well. Don’t eat salads or drink tea. Is Nora in good health. Tell me the truth. Did you send a remittance? I never got it if you did. I wanted to buy a set of furs I have in my mind. Try to get fat. Jim",
