  "text": "Dear G and H: … Stephens was here yesterday with his wife. Like Souppault he gives a very sombre account of things in the U.S. Possibly because they didn’t get merry enough. He has been lecturing too. 40 no less. And I suppose Messrs O’Flaherty and O’Malley are also lecturing to the good people over there who are doing their level best to improve themselves. The other night coming out of Chez Francis my wife found a fine black cat which now is a tenant of the flat. I read your S. Patrick’s Day letter to this graceful animal and you should have seen his prolonged smile. It does not greatly surprise me to hear that America causes Giorgio to vomit. But this is a passing phase. And in time you will get to love it. For the moment it is a mistake to expect too much from your curious circle of friends. Every attempt made up to the present to manufacture a silken purse out of a sow’s ear has proved a failure. Good … who sees a great press story in the Irish son of an Irish father who hopes to sing Irish songs to Irish Americans is not to be blamed if he was not impressed by his voice of Stephen George and tried to mumble out some excuse about lack of music when interpellated by Stephen George’s manageress the next day. Why should he be? If Stephen George came from Italy or France or Germany or one of the Balkan states with a musical name it would be a voice of another colour. Also do not shed too many tears over the fiasco at Mrs Sullivan’s. The audience or what was left of it probably thought Father O’Flynn was a fragment of Emporian music unfinished by the late Mr Gregory. But I am curious to know who of your musical friends taught Giorgio to sing this song. He certainly never heard it from me. The music is by Villiers Stanford. But I dislike it and the words, and most of all Father O’Flynn himself, the so called soggarth aroon (ſagaɼt = sacerdos = priest). But if Giorgio thinks there is no melody in Palmer’s music and that my Swiss composer, as you call him, to wit Othmar Schoeck is not a first class composer it is perhaps because he forgot his musical sense in the rue Huysmans in the hurry of departure…. I don’t know what war you are writing about. There are so many roving about seeking what they may devour. If there is a European war again (which the Lord forfend) I suppose the U.S. will again come in on the last round with the usual 9½ soldiers, captained by Major Collins, and a tin of Heinz’s canned beans. Just to settle up matters…. You complain that my last letter was undated. To make up for this I hereby inform you that this is 1 April—All Fools’ Day.",
