  "text": "Dear Sir I wrote to you at the beginning of October last from Dublin asking you to let me know what you had decided to do with the book of my verses (‘Chamber Music’) which Mr Arthur Symons gave you to consider and in reply I received a card from you saying that you would let me know definitely in a day or two. May I ask you to tell me by return whether you intend to print them or not and, in case you do not intend to print them, to send them to me without delay as I want to try to publish them somewhere as soon as possible and I have already refused to accept the offer of another publishing firm because I thought there was a prospect of your bringing the book out? Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
