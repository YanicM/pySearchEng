  "text": "Dear Budgen: I’ve just come here to Paris from the rainy southern shore. I to Monte Carlo went but I never played a cent. I saw Vogt in Z’ch. The right eye-lens almost calcified. He can’t make up his mind. Two operations at least needed and he is not sure of the result. If good, I could see with a lens as well as most people. But any upset in the eye during the operation might pass to the other and close me vip entirely. The other eye has slightly improved. He gave me a different glass to see better with. Have to go back in autumn. Yes, the sales of U in U.S.A. are remarkable. 33,000 in 10 weeks. But you saw the latest development due to pressure from my infuriated correligionist compatriots and the puritan prohibitionists. Z’ch booksellers retail your book at 15 frs (almost £1) and find few buyers therefore. Could you buy in a copy for me at trade price if your contract allows it or if not at the full figure and have it sent to: Paul Ruggiero 48 Waffenplatz Z’ch I didn’t remember about Fleiner when I was in Z’ch. We were both upset by the tragic death of my friend Borach. Next time I go I shall ring him up. A young Frenchman Armand Petit Jean has written a book, an amazing study of W.i.P. I never even saw him. It will be out in July. He is only 20 and began it 3 years ago! I enclose something about Lucia but prefer not to discuss her case here. It is too long and complicated. She’ll get all right they say. One needs all Job’s patience with Solomon’s wisdom and the Queen of Sheba’s pinmoney thrown in. Please don’t talk about it over there. Not much news here except what you see in the press. I posed for J.E. Blanche and he showed the portrait while I was away. I met Blaise Cendrars who sent you his greetings. He says you were a fine singer in those days. I spoke with the Sargents over the wires of course. He seems to have grown worse. It’s a dreadful pity. Anyhow I hope Marseille does him good. Did he go there in search of quiet? If so, his life’s work is all before him. I’m a wretched correspondent but write whenever you feel disposed or want anything over here. I am sorry we did not meet this time. I was swept off by a French friend of ours in a car to make my first motor trip, about 2500 Km. It was pleasant but I think I prefer Puffing Billy to Swaggering Bob. Schöne Grüsse Sincerely yours James Joyce",
