  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I hope none of the MS was lost. It is eleven pages. The first words are ‘O tell me’ the last ‘waters of. Night!’ I shall send you two pages which have been written round again to replace. But they do not change the piece. It should be read in successive runs. On Monday I shall try to start Shaun the Post. This would make the second part of the book fairly complete with the letter. The first part is not written yet. You did not say if you liked the piece? I read it to Mr Larbaud who was enthusiastic about it. I think I shall fall all of a heap after the Shaun piece. It has been such a struggle. With kindest regards and many thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
