  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I enclose a letter received from Conner which please return when read. What a fine muddle I have got myself into and how pleasant it is to be called a swindler by an American lawyer! There is a crisis in the B.B.C. precipitated by H.N. and Mr Alfred Noyes has started a polemic about me in the Times, T.S.E. says. He considered Huebsch’s terms ‘ludicrous’. I am sending a copy of my letter to Conner also to the Viking Press. Pinker has been bungling things in firstrate fashion and I see by the morning paper that there is a strong movement afoot in England to introduce prohibition as in the U.S.A. If this bill is passed I hope it will be applicable to the solid food cooked in the country. In the middle of all this Messrs Monro Saw write me that they want 6d (sixpence) to give to the Insurance people who say they simply must have a look at my furniture every Saturday with a dark lantern. There are three persons in the Blessed Trinity but it is only on occasions such as this that the Third Person should be invoked. Kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
