  "text": "Dear Mr Quinn: I have received today your cable and have telegraphed to Mr Ezra Pound to transmit to you by cable my acceptance of your very kind and flattering offer to buy the corrected proof sheets of my novel. Mr Pound will cable you asking you to send the money through him, as that seems to me the shortest way. In any case, I am writing also to my publisher in New York instructing him to hand over the sheets to you. I hope you received the presentation copy of my novel which I asked him to send you. I regret that it was not possible to sign it in token of my gratitude for your kindness. I am very glad to hear that the book is meeting with good success in America, for, except one notice in the Chicago Daily News, written by Mr Sell,I have not seen any American reviews. I have been for the past month very ill with my eyes and was even in some danger. Now it seems that I am much better and the doctor is optimistic. Allow me to thank you once more for your kindness and generosity and to assure you that I am very grateful to you for the interest you take in my writing.",
