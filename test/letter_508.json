  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for your letter of 2 November and also for your kind words about my book Ulysses. May I ask you to convey my thanks also to Miss Marsden. I am sorry that you get no satisfaction out of the book such as it is. I gave Mr Lewis’s book1 Tarr. to the critic of the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, which is the leading newspaper in Switzerland (with the Journal de Genève) and he has promised to review it. I shall try to have it reviewed in the Zürcher Post. Miss Guillermet of the Journal de Genève might review it but she wrote that the editor had no space for her notice of Exiles. I enclose a letter which I have received. If you wish you can send a copy of the book to the firm for their client but I would ask you not to arrange anything for the moment. I hope to write to you later on about this matter. If the four copies of the book arrive I shall send one to Mr Brandes. The copies for Messrs Ebell have arrived but not those for Messrs Crès et Cie. Mr Davray’s article has not yet appeared in the Mercure de France nor Mr Vidacovich in the Nuova Antologia but the century is still young. I hope you are well in these dangerous days. I am glad to say that my health is better and my eyes give me no trouble but my sight is very bad sometimes.",
