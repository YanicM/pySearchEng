  "text": "Dear Magee: I am writing to know whether you can give me any information about George Moore’s funeral. I read your name in the list of mourners published in the Morning Post but apparently no other man of letters was either present or represented and none of his Irish friends and colleagues seems to have taken any part in the proceedings. As you know I made the acquaintance of George Moore only a few years before his death and I hope that I behaved towards him during the three or four visits I paid him with the respect due to his age personality and achievements. At his suggestion I tried here to have his Aphrodite in Aulis translated into French. I spoke to my own publisher here and also to Louis Gillet, the literary editor of the Revue des Deux Mondes and a friend of Moore’s and also to the principal french translator of Ulysses an old friend of mine and an excellent English scholar. But all this was of no avail, and the time of crisis was also unfavourable to a limited deluxe edition which seemed the only solution. Of course I was unable to be present at the funeral but on learning of his death I telephoned to London and had a large chaplet wreath of cistapalm and barberry leaves green and brown mixed with an inscription to him and my name. It seems strange that although this was sent to his house long before the funeral no mention of it is made among the floral tributes cited by the press. It has been suggested to me that this list was handed to the press by his family who … and finish the sentence for yourself. I know nothing about his family and care less. I simply wished to pay a tribute to his memory; perhaps you can enlighten me. I hope all is well with you and yours. Since I saw you I have become a grandfather. A little poem by me appeared in the December Criterion and if you care to see it I will send it to you.",
