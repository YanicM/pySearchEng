  "text": "Dear Stannie: Please return these samples of my daily mail by return. What am I to do about that cursed madman in C.? Any use my writing to his chief constable there? Why the hell don’t they put him in an asylum? As for Annie her brother keeps a string of racers and hunters and they won’t let their children mix with mine. If I had the Lsd free I’d send it but I think the scheme harebrained (10 rooms! I cannot let my flat of 3!) I said I would pay his railway fare to Riviera if she could get any money to keep them there. Greetings. Jim",
