  "text": "Dear Stannie, I have had no letter from you for nearly a fortnight so I suppose you are in great difficulties or else that you sent me money which was robbed in the post. In the latter case I hope you have the registration receipt. Today I received Lire 50 for I had to borrow L 100 here ten days ago. I have now 85 lire and must pay my landlady 35 and nearly 5 more for expenses. If you cannot do something at once to help me over this month I do not see how I can live. I cannot ask for an advance here as they told me the last time they were making an exception in my case as it was the first month. Indeed I hope I have not injured my position already by asking for an advance. There are two great patches on the seat of my trousers so that I cannot leave off my coat in the office and sit stewing for hours. Some nights I do not get away till 8 or even 8.30 and, really, to have one’s mind in a turmoil about money as well as to live this way is not pleasant. I would not mind the discomfort if I saw some means of getting over the month. Is it possible A would not give you any advance? I wrote to Grant Richards a week ago: no answer, of course. I have some loose sheets in my pocket about 5 pages to add to A Painful Case but I am not strenuous enough to continue in the face of such continual discouragement. Aunt J sent me papers: no letter. The Irish Catholic and Dialogues of the Day. Unluckily I lost the latter in the street. I shall send you the next copy: it is very ‘brilliant’. Three pages of puff by F.S.S. at the end: full of thick typed catch phrases such as ‘this novelty in Irish journalism’ ‘order at once’ ‘absolutely unique’. An advt appears for some booklet by (very big letters) Thomas Kettle, M.P. A column of the Irish Catholic is devoted to a series of letters between Dr Delany and J.M. O’Sullivan M.A.: philosophical student at Bonn. They are all in the public eye and favour: even Dr O.S. Jesus Gogarty. And here am I (whom their writings and lives nauseate to the point of vomiting) writing away letters for ten hours a day like the blue devil on the offchance of pleasing three bad-tempered bankers and inducing them to let me retain my position while (as a luxury) I am allowed to haggle for two years with the same publisher, trying to induce him to publish a book for which he has an intense admiration. Orco Dio! I bought and read The Lake: and will send it when I know where to send it so that you may tell me what you think of it. The Times calls it a prose poem. You know the plot. She writes long letters to Father Oliver Gogarty about Wagner and the Ring and Bayreuth (memories of my youth!) and about Italy where everyone is so happy (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and where they drink nice wine and not that horrid black porter (O poor Lady Ardilaun over whose lily-like hand he lingered some years back): and then she goes (in all senses of the word) with a literary man named Ellis—one of Moore’s literary men, you can imagine what, silent second cousin of that terribly knowing fellow, Harding—and Father Oliver Gogarty goes out to the lake to plunge in by moonlight, before which the moon shines opportunely on ‘firm erect frame and grey buttocks’: and on the steamer he reflects that every man has a lake in his heart and must ungird his loins for the crossing. Preface written in French to a French friend who cannot read or write English (intelligent artist, however, no doubt) and George Moore, out of George Henry Moore and a Ballyglass lady, explains that he only does it ‘because, cher ami (dear friend), you cannot read me in my own language’ Eh? I like the notion of the Holy Ghost being in the ink-bottle. We go to a little wine-shop opposite the house at night and the proprietor who is delighted with Georgie invited us to dinner some nights ago: sardines, roast veal and tomatoes, salad, a huge English pudding, melons in rum, wine and cognac and cigars. The pudding was the gift of an old priest from Sicily—Padre Michele! though I have made open confession of my ‘heresies’, but I think, really, he meant nothing ill by his mess of pottage—which was excellent. He said he was an old man and thought sometimes of buying a revolver to protect himself from assault at night in the streets and asked me did I approve of that. Have you ever reflected how ‘humble’ is the utterance of Renan ‘very few people have the right to abandon Catholicism’. What do those gentlemen in Ireland want a new University for? The one they have is quite good enough for them—both in ‘saince and in art’. But you must read ‘Dialogues of the Day’. Georgie can understand everything almost that is said to him and imitates every sound he hears—clocks, vendors, singing—etc. Today while Nora and he were passing through a narrow street some hoarse whore of an Italian driving a cart at breakneck speed and flourishing his whip, caught him right under the eye: and he has a long weal across his cheek and nose. Pleasant, isn’t it? It puts my teeth on edge to write of it. I must end now as I have no more time. Scholz wrote me an insolent postcard in French which made me laugh: it was so German. However, I will do what he wants me to do. Oblige me by replying to this at once as you know my position. I don’t wish to ‘sponge’ on you but only to ask you to try and help me over this month: as, otherwise, it will be a poor look-out for me. Already the moon is threatening to shine upon my grey buttocks and I wish some-one would send me a pair of Father Oliver’s small-clothes that he hid among the bulrushes. And if it so happens that you are in difficulties yourself write to me at once. Jim",
