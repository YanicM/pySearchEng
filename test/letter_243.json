The delay in M’s coming is rather awkward but as they say they will send earnest money I suppose they mean business. Nothing can be done in fusees: too dangerous to forward and to make. I have got an agency for Irish tweeds and send Steiner samples tomorrow. Hope Nora got safely my box of gloves and parcel of homespun. Hope you are better. Chuck the exercising. Did T.M.K. acknowledge my present? Examiners not appointed yet. D.J. O’D got librarianship. If M makes as many mistakes travelling as he does in writing Italian he will end in Archangel. Jim",
