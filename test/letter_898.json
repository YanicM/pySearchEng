  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: The phrase about the Waterworld’s face is mine own. Please correct ‘Sir Tristran, violer d’amores, fr’over the short sea, had passencore rearrived fra North Armorica on the scraggy isthmus of Europe Minor’ etc. I sent Yabcd to E.P. at his request and he has written turning it down altogether, can make nothing of it, wading through it for a possible joke etc. I sent you papers about the Roth affair. I have been greatly overworked and overworried these last few weeks and yesterday took to the sofa again. Today I restarted. One great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutanddry grammar and goahead plot. I think you will like the piece better than sample. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
