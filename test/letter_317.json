  "text": "Roberts now wants every proper name (public houses, cakeshops and churches) changed: He also wants me to change the first paragraph in Grace, three paragraphs in Two Gallants, another passage in Ivy Day and part of The Boarding House. I refused to destroy my book by making this latter group of changes. Roberts asked me then to give him £30 for the sheets (which cost £57) and look for a publisher: and asked me to come in tomorrow. I went to Keohler whose brother is a solicitor but the latter is on leave. I went then to Griffith who received me very kindly and remembered my letter. He says I am not the first person from whom he has heard this story. He says Roberts has been playing that game for years. He says the idea of Maunsel sueing me is simple bluff and believes that they will not come into court and that if I get a strong solicitor on my side they will yield. He gave me a note to a first class solicitor in Westmoreland Street. He asked me also to send him copies of my articles in P. d. S and to give him Price’s address. Jim",
