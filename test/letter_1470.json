  "text": "Dear Mr Laughlin, Many thanks for having sent me the book with Prof. Levin’s article. Please convey to the writer my thanks also for his friendly and painstaking study of my book. In the opinion of all those to whom I have shown it his article, beginning with the title, is the most striking one that has appeared so far. An Italian and a Dutch review which I have read (Panorama, Rome, 12 November Rotterdamsche Courant, 3 February) might perhaps interest your critic but he would certainly be more intrigued by an elaborate communication I received from Helsinki so that my title too must be judged appropriate and prophetical. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
