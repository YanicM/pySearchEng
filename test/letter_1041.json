  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver First of all I wish you a happy Xmas. You know part of the news. My wife and daughter-in-law are at present on the most affectionate terms. We were at the marriage which was private but her stupyd lawyer forgot to insert at the mairie the clauses of the contract of separation des biens which by my son’s request had been made a few days before so that my son becomes by French law the monarch of all he surveys. I enclose another letter from Hughes who is going farther every time. He means well but I am in a very awkward position with Milhaud and Jarnach whom I have to meet tonight at a concert not to speak of Antheil who, it seems, at Pound’s suggestion is backing out of Byron and wants me to write a new peppy libretto for him. I wired refusing and sending him a polite ultimatum either to go ahead with my adaptation or let me hand it over to Stravinsky to which he has not yet replied. Mrs Colm has started a scheme with an American publisher for the issue of a Joyce anthology under which I am to get 10,000 dollars she swears but in the meantime the man who at Colin’s suggestion has just brought out an edition de luxe of my essay on Mangan with a preface by C. having got wind of Schwarz’s unauthorised first edition of the same is coyly declining to cable the stipulated (9000 francs. I had no end of trouble between Faber and Faber and Babou and Kahane. By an oversight of Miss Beach’s I signed over to the latter the exclusive rights for H.C.E. so that I had to hold F and F’s book due this week but got permission to bring it out in April by giving B and K an option on the next fragment. I am still suffering from insomnia which is a dreadful bore and I will not be able to complete the first draft before the end of the year if even then. Gorman is engaged on a biography of me for which I have to supply him copiously with information and I am also trying to explain to Miss Monnier’s sister who knows no English the text of Chapelle D’Izzied (the next fragment) for which she is to do a hieroglyph preface. Also I have to help Colm with his preface for Hughes’s book besides assisting at the seances of the French translation of A L P. Things are in a bad mess here on account the the banco-political scandâl and my royalty reserve dropped with a bang just when wedding, Xmas and New Year announced themselves so that I have to realise another £100 immediately and would be greatly convenienced if M and S could advance me half of it the moment they enetter [sic] their office after the Yuletine alltoobrief respite from me. Sullivan has caused delirium in Marseille and has left to sing at the San Carlo of Naples, probably the greatest lyrical theatre in the world but the dunderheads of Covent Garden are still dozomg over him. I hope you got safely his new disc I sent you. One side is poora and the other only fair as … is a wretched firm but of course S. wanted the money and took this offer. Will you please return H8s letter to Miss Beach? This machine is my new toy and that’s my weakness now but the big one I gave Miss Monnier in exchange for it is the bane of her life. My eyes being tired I shall now stop, thanks for so promptly returning letter for Colm who wanted it. With renewed good wishes of a crispnessnice and kindest regards, sincerely yours, James Joyce",
