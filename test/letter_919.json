  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: In view of the enclosed I have decided to publish my 13 pieces of verse (1904–1927) in a tiny volume like the Donne you gave me at 1/– one shelenk a copy and the title: Pomes Penny each [sic]. So they will be out of the way. Darantière ‘gave’ my proofs years ago to a few in his works. There is to be an arbitrage and so on and more lawyers and so forth. The P.E.N. club of London invited James the Punman to be guest of honour at a dinner in London on 5 April. As many English writers signed the protest I accepted. We leave here on 29 instant as it takes a week to cross the Woebegone. The miners at Willingdone also offered to pay my fare up there and give me a ‘royal welcome’ if I would speak to them. I won’t speak but if I went to London I have been thinking of taking a trip Euston–Willingdone–Penrith–Barrow–Holyhead–Dublin–Galway etc. If circumstances allowed it, that is. My father has been writing to me for years. I don’t like so much going to Ireland but I don’t like to refuse him always. Transition is held up a week by legal formalities but I suppose, as you don’t like K any better in his nice print frock that he will not appeal to you even in his 39 articles of clothing. As for me I am working away at the suite (I will sell my chances of going to London to end it all every word. O go on, go on, go on!). The typescript is like a caviare sandwich. Besides trying to revise the German muddle and patching up my wardrobe in order to look like a respectable litteratoor when I sit down at the dinnertable. Please let me know if you approve of the publication. Rushing for the Posht With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce 16. (Ho! Ho! Tomorrow is Potreek’s Day, the sham rogue!) iii.927",
