  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: I will write you in English language. We expect a letter from you by tomorrow (via S.S. Bremen) but I send this off today. Also the fragment of W. i. P. I hope you send us good news, that you are all three well and happy. We are both somewhat dazed by the heavy heat here. I work every day alone at my big long wide high deep dense prosework. We went to hear Gigli (who sang in a gymnasium, Palais des Sports, but has a beautiful voice. He imitates MacCormack but has an ampler organ—not so true.) S. in La Favorite (this time he surprised us all by his acting). La Machine Infernale, very well given. Mrs E.J. and Mrs Nora J. went to the Folies Bergères while E.J. and I went to see a Palestine company playing Jacob and Rachel in … Hebrew, not Yiddish. It was very remarkable and barbaric. I enclose this letter from S. to Pitt Sandborn. We have not yet made any summer plans. What a bore. Will let you know as soon as we do. They called in a German specialist at Nyon and he advised them to treat Lucia as if she had something or other, though there is no trace of it. And this apparently is doing her good. She sent me a silk tie she knitted. She doesn’t seem to know the kind of collars I wear. But it’s otherwise very nice and I’ll get it altered. I hope the book cheers her up. It is very well done. We are looking for a flat. I am having my teeth fixed. But you are the people to send the news. Gillet did not get into the Academy. There was a spoiled vote. So he has to run again. Carducci came around and let me hear his Norma. I am going to speak to Mrs Dyer about it. He brought the Contessa with him. Our best wishes to you both and regards to your host and trilingual greetings to your lively charge. I shake all your amalgamated hands several times over in rapid succession with that charming grace for which I have always been noted and blow to you in valediction my parento-legal blessings from this little old log cabin down the Seine. Babbo PS Dears Helen and Giorgio I hope you are having a fine time we are quite well, Paris misses you both lots of love to Stevie Nora",
