  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards Thanks for your letter and copy of paper. I do not see notices and in fact had written to ask you if you get them. It is very kind of you to bring the book under the notice of your friends. Will you please dispose of the 3 copies as follows: The two copies for Malta [and Trieste] had better be sent registered. Will you kindly let me have also your account for these seven (7) copies together with the postages so that I may remit you cheque in settlement of the lot. You ask about other books. Have you not seen my novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man? Its publication began (serially) in the Egoist (London) last January. Perhaps you could see the numbers already issued. I shall of course, as agreed between us, give you the opportunity of publishing it next year in book. If you cannot find the papers I could send you my copies. I like the print of Dubliners and the cover. There are, however, a few mistakes which your printer did not correct. I suppose they can be changed in a future impression. Sincerely yours James Joyce.",
