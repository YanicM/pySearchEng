  "text": "Dear Mr Sykes: At the beginning of the MS (page 9 of rough copy, probably 6 or 5 of yours) is the phrase ‘He folded his razor and with the feeling polpastrelli of the fingers of his right hand touched his jaws and chin’. In the version you have I have changed the phrase but please tell me what is there now as I want to change it slightly again. Sorry to trouble you but it means only the addition of one or two words. You may remember I found some difficulty there. Glad to hear from M.K. that you have the machine. Kind regards to Mrs Sykes. Cat and others well. Will send more MS I hope very soon.",
