  "text": "Dear Stannie Please arrange with your landlord to have room ready for Bödoker’s lesson 8–9 tonight. Otherwise let me know and I must telephone him to abandon the lesson as he can’t come here. On the understanding that you would keep the house I laid out what I got in paying bills. The 25 Cr. you gave Nora will last till Thursday evg. After that what do you expect me to do? You owe me: 1.60 (balance theatre) 2.50 (half of 5 lire sent May) 4.10 I wish you would save me these continual rows as I have already too many worries. I will take A Set of Six. Leave it out for me and Bartoli’s magazine. By the way, we must arrange his walk. He will be offended if not. Kindly give it up, as I am unwell: and tell me how I am to feed the house. Jim",
