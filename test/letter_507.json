On the 1 May 1918 I went to the British consulate, Zurich, to collect 25 francs due to the ‘English Players’ by an employee of the consulate, Mr Henry Carr, on tickets sold to and unpaid by him for the production by the ‘English Players’ on the 29 April 1918 of ‘The Importance of being Earnest’ in which Mr Carr, at the invitation of the producer for the ‘English Players’, Mr Claud Sykes, had played a part. Mr Carr declined to pay this sum, demanded from me 150 francs in addition to the sum he had already received and when I declined to pay this sum, on the instruction of Mr Sykes, informed me that he would organise a boycott of all our future productions, called me in the presence of witnesses ‘a cad and a swindler’ and threatened to ‘wring my neck the next time he met me in the street’. I replied ‘That is not language that should be used in a government office’ and thereupon left the office. On the 1 May 1918 I wrote a registered letter to Mr Consul Bennett here complaining of this treatment and demanding an apology from Mr Carr. No answer was returned. I then placed the matter in a solicitor’s hands and passed Mr Carr’s threat of assault over to the Zurich police. On the advice of the lawyer of the British consulate, Dr George Wettstein, Mr Carr advanced his claim to 475 francs and claimed that the British consulate is extraterritorial. The Swiss political department, appealed to by my solicitor, Dr Conrad Bloch, disallowed this latter claim. Since the 1 May 1918 the ‘English Players’ have given or are about to give eight public performances of English plays, alone or in conjunction with Italian and French companies, largely and generously supported by the American colony and by Swiss and others interested in English literature. The plays given include works by Browning, Wilde, Synge, Houghton, Mr Shaw and sir James Barrie. The boycott threatened by Mr Carr exists for since the 1 May 1918 Mr Consul Bennett has not been present at any performance and, at the instigation of Mr Carr, has done all in his power to malign and counteract our efforts. In July 1918 when I lay dangerously ill and in danger of blindness Mr Consul Bennett wrote me a registered letter inviting me to compound a felony with him and threatening to penalise, me if I refused to do so. Of this document I declined in courteous terms to take service. On the 15 October 1918 the Swiss court gave judgment in my favour, ruled out the counterclaim of 475 francs advanced by Dr Wettstein on behalf of his client and condemned Mr Carr to pay the sum due and all costs. A copy of this judgment is enclosed. The ‘English Players’ is the only enterprise in Switzerland which has done anything for English dramatic literature. The expenses incurred by Mr Sykes and myself amount to U 10,000 franc We have not received any subsidy and our balancesheet shows a large deficit in spite of our moral success. What we have done cost us enormous work under enormous difficulties and, at Mr Sykes request I enclose a letter from the prime minister, Mr Lloyd George [that] recognises the merits of our efforts. I believe that Your Excellency will hold, as I hold, that it is no part of the duties of consular officials, as set forth in the acting instructions issued by the foreign office, to commit or to aid and abet blackmail and assault or to organise a calumnious boycott of English literature or to invite British subjects to compound felony and threaten to penalise them if they decline to do so. As Mr Consul Bennett has shown tacit and open approval of the aforesaid acts of blackmail and assault and attempted felony and has not replied to my grave charge against an employee of his office I appeal, as one of His Majesty’s subjects and as a man of letters whom His Majesty has honoured by a munificence in recognition of services rendered to English literature, to Your Excellency the official representative of His Majesty in this country, and crave from Your Excellency that protection and redress from the insult of violence which are the right and the privilege of the least of His Majesty’s subjects. I am, Your Excellency’s obedient servant James Joyce",
