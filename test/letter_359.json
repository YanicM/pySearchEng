  "text": "Dear Sir My friend, Mr Pound, has sent me on your memorandum agreement. Your proposal seems to me to be very favourable to me. I am afraid, however, that it ought to be recast in a slightly different form. As regards dramatic rights I can hand these over to you at once and without reserve. I have written a play in three acts, Exiles, but should prefer to hold it over till my novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man has been published in book form. Mr Grant Richards, publisher, of 8 Saint Martin’s Street, Leicester Square, London, has the right of refusal of my novel. He has also the same right for other books written by me for the next four years. As I do not write very quickly I think it would be better to make a separate agreement with you for each book. That for my novel should be conditional on Mr Grant Richards’ refusal of the book rights. I have heard nothing from him about the book and do not know whether he wishes to publish it or not. I have written to him and begged him to let me know as soon as possible. The agreement for the cession of the dramatic rights of my play could be unconditional. If you think you can make these arrangements I shall be very happy to place my writings in your hands. I shall return the memorandum of agreement or make additions to it or deletions in it, signed or unsigned, according to your further instructions. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
