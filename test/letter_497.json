  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: After nine weeks’ illness I am at last able to read and write again. I am sorry that the other episodes of Ulysses have been delayed. A few days [ago] I sent the sixth episode ‘Hades’ to Mr Pound with a copy for you and very soon I shall send the seventh ‘Eolus’. I received also The Voyage Out by Mrs Woolf and shall now begin to read it. I beg you to convey my thanks to her for the interest she has taken in the printing of my book. If you are in correspondence with my American publisher I shall feel obliged if you will please tell him that I agree to his publishing Chamber Music, in spite of the Boston edition, with a note to say that I authorise the edition. No verses written by me since its first publication are to be added to it. I am much obliged to him for his friendly inquiries about my health, but do not know what to answer except that for the moment I am well. This is a bad climate for me, I fear. I wish him to know that the fourth episode of Ulysses as published in the June issue of the Little Review is not my full text and that the excised paragraphs must be reinstated and the altered words restored in any proof he may set up. I have received this evening Mr Lewis’s novel Tarr. I am very grateful to him for his kind thought in sending it and if I knew his address would write to thank him for it. I shall try to get it noticed in some Swiss papers. I agree, of course, to the proposed change in our agreement or to any other you may suggest…. A Miss Maja Maag, Ahlmannsallée 15, Hellerup, Denmark, is thinking of translating the book into Danish. I am not sure whether she has read it or not. She has seen some notices, I believe. It might be worth while to send her a review copy as I hear she writes for some paper. A friend of mine here has promised to bring the book under the notice of Mr Brandes. Should you decide to send him a copy his address is: Prof. George Brandes Strandboulevard 27 Copenhagen. I shall follow it up with a letter. I need scarcely say that I should deem it a great honour if Mr Brandes took any interest in the book. I shall write to Miss Maag tomorrow. Her letter came some time ago but I could not write till now. I sent you today a notice in the Secolo of Milan. The notice written by my friend Mr Vidacovich has not yet appeared in the Nuova Antologia. I saw the number of 15 July today. The article was sent in last month. I hope you got a leaflet of continental press notices I sent. I had only 100 printed for I hope to be able to add more and the type is still set up.",
