  "text": "Dear Gunn: As you kindly suggested I am sending a written message for M. Paul LÃ©on (he will not trouble you much more for he is conscribed as from Tuesday next), namely, that I have now received the complete proofs of my biography and have written the N.Y. publisher that I shall deal with them directly. In this connection perhaps it may amuse you to look over the illustrations so I am leaving them and shall pick them up tomorrow from your hall porter if you will be good enough to leave them with him for me. Many thanks in advance sincerely yours James Joyce",
