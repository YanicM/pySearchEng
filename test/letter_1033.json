  "text": "Dear Mr Gorman: Please thank Mrs Gorman very much for the Scotch plaid ties, one of which I will wear for the portrait if Augustus John allows me. A copy of Ulysses was sent in the French F.O. bag in care of Mr Poliakoff (whom you can ring up after Wednesday) 49 Queen’s Gate Gardens. Before you leave London may I trouble you to fetch it and give it to the night porter of the Euston from me, explaining the delay as the diplomatic courier is not always available. He is on duty only from 10.30 p. m. and his name is Charles Stevens. The enclosed has just come from Ogden. Will you read it quickly and pass it on to T.S.E, asking him to return it to me at once. I wish to know whether F & F’s scheme has dropped (as seems to be the case) before replying to C.K.O. In great matutinal haste and with my thanks Sincerely yours James Joyce",
