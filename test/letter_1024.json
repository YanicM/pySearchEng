  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I agree on condition that A.L.P. is published before the 31 December next. But please ring up T.S. Eliot at Faber and Faber’s on the proposal as also about his plan of publishing H.C.E. in the same miscellany. This should appear before the end of February 1931 as the fourth and final fragment is to be published in an edition de luxe as usual first in Paris in April next. These fragments from what reviewers call Work in Progress really have no title but for convenience’ sake a few words taken from the text have been put on the title page. I wrote all this letter with my own hand and can even make out the words but I hope it is legible to others Sincerely yours James Joyce",
