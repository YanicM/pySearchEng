  "text": "Dear Sir, I have almost finished a book which I would like to submit to you. It is called ‘Dubliners.’ It is a collection of twelve short stories. Each story is perhaps of 1800 or 2000 words. The book is not a collection of tourist impressions but an attempt to represent certain aspects of the life of one of the European capitals. I am an Irishman, as you will see by the name. I am anxious that the book should be published as soon as possible and this is the reason why I offer it to you beforehand. I shall be much obliged if you will tell me whether you would like to read it or not and excuse me if my request is an unusual one. Faithfully yours, Jas. A. Joyce",
