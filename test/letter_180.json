  "text": "I received and signed Mathews’ agreement, as I told you. I wrote also to Long, as I told you, but that son of a bitch hasn’t answered me yet. So I wrote to him peremptorily the day before yesterday. Ulysses never got any forrader than the title. I have other titles, e.g. The Last Supper, The Dead, The Street, Vengeance, At Bay. all of which stories I could write if circumstances were favourable. I wrote to Berlin some days ago for the Danish Berlitz Book which has just appeared. The news here is that we leave our present quarters on the 15th and go to live in the Corso, where Nora found a room. I expect she will be satisfied for a week or so. She is, as Reynolds’s Newspaper would say, enceinte. Georgie is weaned. We eat lunch in the house and dine in a trattoria in the night. I took Nora and Georgie to a comic opera on Sunday ‘Le Carnet du Diable’. I was very bored by the end. It was very silly and musicless. The artistes had no voices: but just one topnote or so. Georgie crowed now and again and when he did an idiot in front of us turned round angrily and said ‘Sh!’ I suppose he was afraid of missing some priceless sentence of the dialogue. I read a few volumes of G de M. lately for amusement and was amused by the same. Now I am on to Anatole France again. But if I want real esthetic satisfaction I must wait till the MS of Dubliners returns to me once more to roost. I have divided my papers, sending you Independent and Mail and Connellan the others. By the way, the old servant in our place because we are leaving will not call me in the morning as she used to. Formerly she used to backbite her mistress to Nora: and she got a New Year’s gift from Nora. She passes the door a dozen times in the morning without knocking. Isn’t stupidity of that kind distressing? I could tell you another pretty story about women. If you can spare the time you might just run over to London and kick John Long’s long arse for a few minutes or so, will you? He hasn’t answered me yet. Symons wrote me another card a day or two ago, asking had I come to terms with Mathews and repeating that he would do all he could for the book when it came out. I mustn’t forget to dedicate it to O.G. or perhaps to the memory of his mother. Do you remember my parody of Leo XIII’s prayer after mass? It has come into my mind just now and made me laugh. Baby, Poppie, Pappie and Charlie sent me picture postcards on my birthday!!! The postcards are all coloured green, dark sea, sage, emerald, cabbage &c. In the school here there is another Dubliner teaching, named Craig. He is another Mug Ryan in appearance, tries very hard to conceal the drap in his accent, comes from Kingstown. Has an irritatingly slow way of talking, looking at the ground, appearing to meditate before he emits a word. I suppose you saw old Cusack is dead. I have given up reading Avanti but enclose paragraph for Artifoni. It was too dull for me. Kindly write soon and long. About the money I find it difficult to do more than pull along. Remember there are three people now. And I suppose it will be worse when there are four but however…. I suppose I shall make a few shillings out of the verses. Jim",
