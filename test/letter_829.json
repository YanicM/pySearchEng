  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver I came back here yesterday fairly well to have a rest before the operation and to try to revise the piece for Mr Eliot. The operation was to be Monday but a violent rainstorm came on during the night which has set me back a little and this morning they think it must be put off for a couple of days. With this attack in the good eye I am practically helpless but I managed to do some revision even in the dark as I want to send off the piece before I go back. The conjunctivitis turned into what is called episcleritis. This, Dr Borsch says, can be terribly painful but unlike iritis is not dangerous in itself and leaves no traces. I was sent to the clinic. Six leaches were applied but nevertheless the pain especially during the nights was bad. On Friday night I really thought I was as near unreason as my worst critics think me but they gave me some morphine which gave me relief. This crisis is now past but I wish the whole thing was over. I don’t think Exiles was a great success. There is neither a motor car nor a telephone in it. I will try to send you the MS by Mr McAlmon if I see him. I should be glad to hear Mr Muir’s article read to me before I send off the piece which is an indirect reply to criticisms. I will end this now as my eye is a little troublesome. I shall see Dr Borsch tonight and hope fervently I will soon have definite good news to send. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
