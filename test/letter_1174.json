  "text": "Dear Budgen: I am sorry but the state of health, to say nothing of other worries, in which I find myself will not permit me to read the proofs of your book to which I wish every possible good success. Kindly notify your publishers of this fact as they might use my name in this connection in their advertisements in which case I should have to ask my agent in England to contradict their statement in the press. I shall write you about the picture tomorrow. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
