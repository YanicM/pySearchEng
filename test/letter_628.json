  "text": "Dear Mr Quinn: In reply to your letter I have just wired you in code to advance terms of offer to Huebsch so that my royalty reached $3 or $3.50 per copy. My reasons are: If Huebsch raises any objection, please withdraw the offer entirely and the typescript. Circe is finished and being typed. When it reaches New York the whole book so far can be set up and sent to me. I shall return it corrected a few days after receipt, with the Eumeus episode and probably Ithaca also. The second revise can be sent me then and I shall return it with the final episode, Penelope. This last is a short episode—can be checked by the proofreader, in whom I have more confidence now that your continent is ‘dry’…. I wrote the Circe Episode nine times from first to last. When Ulysses is finished, after seven years of labour (diversified by eight illnesses and nineteen changes of address, from Austria to Switzerland, to Italy, to France), I shall need six months’ rest—not necessarily in jail.",
