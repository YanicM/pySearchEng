  "text": "Dear Mr Sweeney: I sent two airmail letters yesterday to N.Y.: one to Mr Cerf, one to the Viking Press. I asked that royalties due to me on the 1 prox be cabled me c/o U.S. Embassy at Vichy (which is charged with protection of British subjects) through the State Department at Washington, U.S. income tax and agents’ fees being deducted. I also asked Mr Cerf for an advance of royalties. My position is this: my wife, son, grandson and I are here in the ‘free zone’, my daughter is near S. Nazaire in the ‘unfree zone’—a danger point. I have asked the Swiss authorities whether they permit British subjects to enter Switzerland as I want to try to transfer my daughter (who is in a maison de santé) to Zurich and to go there ourselves. No reply has come after about 20 days. I do not even know whether the French and German authorities, respectively, will allow us to leave this country. My supplies of income from London have been cut off for over two months and a half. My bank balance in France is blocked: and I am consequently in arrears of payment (through no fault of mine) with the maison de santé of my daughter, my hotel at Vichy and other bills. I am writing you as Mr Cerf may not be in N.Y. and the Viking Press cannot be relied on to act promptly. If Mr Cerf is away could you see someone at Random House who replaces him? If so, you will greatly oblige me. My plan, even if feasible, will be extremely costly as my daughter will need a medical escort (doctor and nurse) across France when and if anybody can travel by road, rail or otherwise anywhere in the country.",
