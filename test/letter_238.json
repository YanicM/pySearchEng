  "text": "My poor little lonely Nora I let so many days go by without writing because only a few minutes before I left Trieste you called me an imbecile because I came home late after being so busy all day. But now I am sorry for you. Please, Nora, do not say these things to me any more. You know I love you. Busy as I am ever since I came I think all day of what presents I can bring you. I am trying to buy for you a splendid set of sable furs, cap, stole, and muff. Would you like that? I feel the day all wasted here among the common Dublin people whom I hate and despise. My only consolation is to speak about you to my sisters whenever I can as I used to do to your sister Dilly. It is very cruel for us to be separated. Do you think now of the words on your ivory necklet F I have three distinct images of you always in my heart this time. First, as I saw you the instant I arrived. I see you in the corridor, looking young and girlish in your grey dress and blue blouse and hear your strange cry of welcome. Second, I see you as you came to me that night when I lay asleep on the bed, your hair loose about you and the blue ribbons in your chemise. Lastly, I see you on the platform at the station the moment after I said goodbye to you, half turning away your head in grief with such a strange posture of helplessness. You dear strange little girl! And yet you write to ask if I am tired of you! I shall never be tired of you, dearest, if you will only be a little more polite⁠[.] I cannot write you so often this time as I [am] dreadfully busy from morning to night. Do not fret, darling. If you do you will ruin my chances of doing anything. After this I hope we shall have many many many long years of happiness together. My dear true good little Nora do not write again doubtfully of me. You are my only love. You have me completely in your power. I know and feel that if I am to write anything fine or noble in the future I shall do so only by listening at the doors of your heart. What nice talks we had together this time, had we not, Nora? Well, we will again, dear. Coraggio! Please write me a nice letter, dear, and tell me you are happy. Tell my handsome little son that I will come to kiss him some night when he is fast asleep and not to fret for me and that I hope he is better and tell that comical daughter of mine that I would send her a doll but that ‘l’uomo non ha messo la testa ancora’. Now, my little bad-tempered bad-mannered splendid little girl, promise me not to cry but to give me courage to go on with my work here. I wish you would go to Madame Butterfly and think of me when you hear the words ‘Un bel di’ Jim Keep my letters to yourself, dear. They are written for you.",
