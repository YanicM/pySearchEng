  "text": "Saw Yeats in London. For a wonder he was polite: gave me tea and Georgie fruit. He has rewritten Countess Cathleen and sends the new version of it to Vidacovich through you. His theatrical agent for the continent will be Cippico, who has read V’s MS and admires it but thinks it a little remote from common speech. Saw Roberts. He says the Giant’s Causeway is soft putty compared with me. The new proposals are: either the passage in Ivy Day and a passage in An Encounter are to be deleted, replaced by asterisks and with a note of preface by me or the book is to be bought over by me, bound and printed, on my note of hand for the cost amount and issued by Simpkin Marshall of London who will spread it on commission, the profits being mine. Write and advise me at once which way you prefer. Dublin very discouraging. Charles made a good impression on me—a decent poor fellow. Will do what I can for him. Jim Kind regards from Nora and her uncle.",
