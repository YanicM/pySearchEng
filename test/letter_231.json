  "text": "Dear Stannie I got your wire ‘more impossible return immediately’. I am raising the rest from my publishers and all three leave on Thursday night. Get bed. I send copies of papers containing notice of my article and T.M.K’s wedding. See that Prezioso and Vidacovich see the allusions to me and to P.d.S. Copies of these papers as well as original P.d.S. you sent me are being sent tonight to G.B.S himself by my publisher with an account of me and of my forthcoming book Dubliners asking him to do what he can for it. Kindly post copies of P.d.S. with this last article at once to: W.A. Henderson, Abbey Theatre, Marlborough Street, Dublin Esq Gilbert Beazley Esq, c/o Evening Telegraph, Dublin Tell my pupils that I am resuming lessons from 15 Sept. Keep on the piano. Get table and stools from my carpenter and tell him everyone will be well paid during the winter. For Jesus’ sake don’t attack me with bills the moment I get in. We go tomorrow night and perhaps on Saturday or Sunday will reach Trieste. Eva was operated yesterday (thanks to me) by Woods and is better today. She will be able to travel tomorrow. Eileen is to begin at the Leinster School of Music in October and I have engaged to pay 5/– a month for her: that will be 3 crowns for each of us. Canvass your pupils to begin. Form classes. Make plenty of money. I will make £500 out of Dubliners if they sell 12,000 copies. Jim",
