  "text": "Dear Mr Rodker: The case of Books papers etc which I sent on from Trieste to enable me to write seems to be lost. I sent it on 29 June last. Have you any spare copies of the Little Review containing my novel? I should be glad to have them even temporarily as my copies were in the case. To add to this, I have received notice to quit this flat (if one can call it so) within a few weeks. Thanks for your kind words about the Oxen of the Sun episode. My New York publisher Mr Huebsch is in Paris and I shall speak to him of your suggestion. Kindest regards to Mrs Rodker and yourself from us all Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Has no number of the Little Review appeared since May–June?",
