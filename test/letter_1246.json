  "text": "Dear G and H: I can’t write much as my eyes are troubling me—either the awful damp or the window open or the dust of the books I was unpacking. All your pictures are safe in the rue Claire, also a box of all the 1st editions etc so carefully ticketed by Giorgio. Will send policy of insurance on Saturday. Here’s the receipt anyhow. And a letter from L. You will see by the tone and writing that she is getting on well. Am glad S had a good party after all. Send us a photograph. Also to hear your father, H, is better. Now for the songs. I have found Philadelphia for you at least have just written L in London where she can get it. I send today the songs promised. I had a new copy made of 3 settings of my verses by Palmer, made about 25 years ago but better than any of the subsequent ones, viz, Gentle Lady At That Hour Donnycarney (this one has been set by at least 12 composers) Will send them also on Saturday. Blatherskite (vuol dire bubbole, fandonie, millanterie) is not Irish at all but Scotch American, I suppose the song meant is Maggie Lauder. In Ireland the word is blatherumskite. Perbacco! Meritava proprio studiare 6 anni per cantare simile robaccia. Silent, O Moyle. Of course I know it, IT. You must have heard me sing it often. The best setting is by Sir Henry Bishop. It goes very well with a harp accompaniment. But 0 Ye Dead is the song for G. Little Red Fox (An Modereen Ruadh) a charming little fanciful song. Moore (Thomas) used it in the melody Let Erin Remember. This melody is about Lough Neagh under which there is said to be buried a kind of Atlantis. Others say Finn MacCool in anger took a sod of turf out of Ireland and flung it in the sea, thus making 1) Lough Neagh 2) Isle of Man. Non mi sento bene. Malora, questi vechi! Queen of Connemara. Pity they sent this in the higher key by mistake. None of these songs is much, really. There is a very nice song by Hughes to words of Colum. ‘O Men from the Fields’. Try for this. It sounds a bit Russian. I suppose the Blatherskite is that tawdry thing supposed to be ‘tο an ould ancient air of ould Ireland’ after all, about women and kissing. O dear! If he sings Silent, O Moyle though the man you mention, H, named Fisher has good ideas, such as the harp suggestion, he almost always smothers the melody and there is some flaw in his harmonic ear. Bishop keeps the line of the air free. But I should like to hear Giorgio sing O ye Dead. Some fool marked the 2nd verse (the reply of the ghosts) as F, This is nonsense. Enough of yellow paper, Irish wails and my sticky eyes. If only I had a fine basso profondo but not to sing B. Kyrie eleison, Gospodi pomilyou, Miserere Nobis O Lord, have mercy on U.S. Tante belle cose Babbo",
