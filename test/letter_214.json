  "text": "My darling I am terribly upset that you haven’t written. Are you ill? I have spoken of this affair to an old friend of mine, Byrne, and he took your part splendidly and says it is all a ‘blasted lie’. What a worthless fellow I am! But after this I will be worthy of your love, dearest. I sent you three enormous bags of shell cocoa today. Tell me if you get them right. My sister Poppie goes away tomorrow. Today I signed a contract for publication of Dubliners. Excuse me to Stannie for not writing to him. My sweet noble Nora, I ask you to forgive me for my contemptible conduct but they maddened me, darling between them. We will defeat their cowardly plot, love. Forgive me, sweetheart, won’t you? Just say a word to me, dearest, a word of denial and O I shall be so transported with happiness! Are you well, my darling? You are not fretting, are you? Don’t read over those horrible letters I wrote. I was out of my mind with rage at the time. I must go down now all the way to the G.P.O. to post this as the post has gone here: it is after one at night. Good night ‘my precious’! No man, I believe, can ever be worthy of a woman’s love. My darling, forgive me. I love you and that is why I was so maddened only to think of you and that common dishonourable wretch. Nora darling, I apologise to you humbly. Take me again to your arms. Make me worthy of you. I will conquer yet and then you will be at my side. Good night ‘my dearest’ ‘my precious’. A whole life is opening for us now. It has been a bitter experience and our love will now be sweeter. Give me your lips, my love. ‘My kiss will give peace now And quiet to your heart. Sleep on in peace now, O you unquiet heart’ Jim",
