  "text": "Dear Pound: Messrs Box and Cox, interviewed by you, sent me three days ago with a much-ado-about-nothing letter a crossed cheque (£10) drawn by Box on Cox which, as I foresaw, no bank in Paris would touch with a 40 foot pole. Finally Miss Beach put it into her account and paid me the money—470 frs. A series of articles ought to appear in the press, possibly by cable also to U.S.A. e.g.: Joyce gets Large Haul. Prompt Pinker Saves Desperate Dedalus. Glut of Greenbacks for Poet in Poverty. The enclosed letter from Huebsch is, I think, dubious; and his £25 on account of royalties on Ulysses seems to me a very remote possibility. He will probably remit £9.19.0 royalties to date, and Pinker will write asking me to send him a P.O. for 1/– due by me to him in excess of advance. 26 was Lucia’s birthday: 27 Giorgio’s. Not having received any money I was sitting gloomily silent on the latter day when Mr Rodker arrived. Hearing my story Mrs Rodker and he very kindly invited this whole vagabond family out to dinner which was providential. Goll, whom I knew in Zurich, called. He wants books for a modern anthology and talked of buying German rights of Portrait for 7– francs sometime, if possible, perhaps. I heard no more about the bed so I wrote to Bradley but had no answer. I heard and saw no more of the many lucky mortals who made my acquaintance here. I suspect that the pleasure my exhilarating company gave them will last for the rest of their natural existences. Except Vanderpyl. He says that Fels is hopelessly in debt, Action doomed to disappear etc. but Mrs Bloch has already done the first chapter. As regards the information concerning the intelligent government official (who should go with Pinker as secretary to the Nith Office when Rumbold is made king of Neland) I believe the instigation came direct from the consul in Zurich, Mr Percy Bennett, at present in Panama. As no one has taken any steps to remind him that he is a public servant he can sleep peacefully. The typescript could not have seemed suspicious except Sirens which was published long after the armistice. And as for said government official if he has no money to give let me never hear of him again in this life or the next. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. of Quinn. Nothing. Rien. Nichts. E poi nulla.",
