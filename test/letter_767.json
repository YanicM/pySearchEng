  "text": "Dear McAlmon: I confirm my telegram ‘Cheque received etc’. Has that cheque come through? There is a lot of mail for you lying at Miss Beach’s. She is away. Miss Moschos does not know what to do with it. Perhaps the cheque is here. My solicitors usually send it registered. Would it have been delivered, if so? In France, I think not. Send me a line in reply if you can as soon as this reaches you if it does. Pound was in hospital for threatened appendicitis but comes out tomorrow. He leaves for Italy on Tuesday. The 4th edition of Ulysses is out. We are threatened with a flood here but the rise is less today. 1924 begins well. In haste sincerely yours James Joyce",
