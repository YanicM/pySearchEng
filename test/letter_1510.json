  "text": "Dear Mr Zumsteg, Many thanks indeed for your kind and prompt action. I received this morning your letter of the 14th inst. with copy of your letter to M. Georges Haldenwang, to whom I wrote after telephoning you but without giving details. I shall send these to-morrow to him in a separate letter. However he knows the name and the number of applicants for entrance. Our demands for entrance should have been at the Swiss Consulate in Lyons on Sunday morning, and so I telegraphed you this morning asking you to verify this, and, if possible, speed up the application. Communications between here and Vichy, postal and otherwise, become more and more difficult, so if there is anything very urgent, you had better either wire me or telephone. With regard to my daughter, can you let me know after enquiry where the railway line from Paris to Switzerland passes the line of demarcation, and how long is the railway journey across the unoccupied zone, and at what Swiss frontier station it enters Switzerland by present arrangements. I am in correspondence with the Maison de Santé Pré Carré, Corcelles, railway station Chavornay, line Lausanne-Yverdon, and they could have arranged to meet her at Vallorbe, as they wrote me, evidently not knowing that this station was out of action. The persons who accompany my daughter eventually will probably have permission to conduct her only as far as the line of demarcation, so I shall have to send details of this new complication to the Director of the Maison de Santé. As you see, everything is extremely difficult. Our applications, for exits from France that is, for myself, my wife, my son and grandson, passed through the sous-préfecture of this department this morning, whence they will be forwarded for consideration to the Minister of the Interior in Vichy. I shall inform you by telephone or telegram the moment I know the result. As regards your visit to Paris, can you let me know the date of this, the probable length of your stay in Paris, and your address there. It is most kind of you to offer to place funds at my disposal which, it seems to me, I might need at some unexpected moment. I gratefully accept this offer, and shall of course reimburse your father at the earliest opportunity. It would be well however, if you are leaving Lyons on short notice, to instruct some member of your staff so that, in case of your absence, I could telephone him and have the amount telegraphed here. As regards the financial guarantee for Switzerland, I have no relatives there, but, as soon as we arrive there, or very soon after both my son and myself will be financially independent, as you know. If my statement should need any corroboration from a Swiss source, I take it, that your Firm in Zürich would be able to guarantee the truth of my statement, so as to reassure the Federal authorities on this point. I shall therefore leave it to your own discretion to communicate on the matter with Mr. Rudolf Brauchbar, or M. Georges Haldemvang, or both, so that this point may not cause a hitch in the procedure. In haste and with renewed thanks and friendly remembrances Sincerely yours James Joyce",
