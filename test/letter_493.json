  "text": "Dear Mr Richards: Am glad to hear Exiles is at last ready. Please be sure to send all the presentation copies and extra press copies I wrote of as well as those for the two Zurich booksellers and for me. As regards my book of stories it is regrettable that you cannot bring out a second edition at once. I know that lately booksellers in Dublin (Combridge among others) have disposed of copies of the first edition at three times the original price—not of course in the ordinary way of business but by private exchange. When there is a demand it is a pity that you cannot supply. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
