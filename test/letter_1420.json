  "text": "Dear Signora: Here is all that I have been able to find thus far. We are about to move. What fun! If I find other letters from Schmitz (I must have several), I will send them to you. Thank you for the pamphlet. That man would do well to buy himself a little glue. The products of his press remind me of Come le foglie of Giacosa. But the important thing is that Svevo be read and written about. I never receive any word from my brother. I wrote him twice, but received no answer. I hope he is well. I hope that you too are well, dear Signora Schmitz. May I venture to wish you peace and happiness on the eve of the Easter holidays? In any case, that is what I do.",
