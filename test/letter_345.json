  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards I received and returned corrected some ten or twelve days ago the first proofs of Dubliners: and expect to receive the revise in a few days. I should mention that in the proof received one batch—pp 113 to 128—seems to be spaced differently from the others. Also, the original frontispiece or title page was not returned, as I requested: and I should be sorry not to have it. Perhaps you can find it for me. Can you let me know the date of publication? Perhaps the press notices which I send under separate cover may be useful for insertion in copies sent to the press. In any case I have sent 65 sheets and hope, as the notices of my first book are favourable, that you may be able to use them in the way I suggest. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
