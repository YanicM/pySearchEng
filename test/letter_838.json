  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am home again but I cannot report anything yet. There is a slight, very slight return of vision in the operated eye. I believe I have to wait for some weeks yet. The other eye is not yet cured and I cannot read print at all without ‘the loan of a lens to see as much as I once saw’. I am heartily tired of iodine, aspirine and scopolamine. In your letter you mention something called warm sunlight. What is it like? There are allusions to it in the works of the great writers. Will you please send Leader on to Miss Beach when read. Dr Sigerson’s statement about the Norse in Ireland before S. Patrick justifies my precipitate jumbling of the fifth and tenth centuries in the last phase of Shaun (‘Norske He raven flag etc’). I go to the clinic every morning and rue de la Paix every evening. Do you know the poem Little Jim ‘The cottage was a thatched one.’ I rhyme it The clinic was a patched one Its outside old as rust And every stick beneath that roof Lay four foot thick in dust. I do not think the delay is Dr Borsch’s fault. It is either mine or of that group of circumstances called Paris. I hope this will reach you before you leave the country. I have some proofs to correct for Mr McAlmon and I had better do it before the other eye gets disabled. My lease here has now 19 days to run!",
