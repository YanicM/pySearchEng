I hope you get it soon. Many thanks. I like it very much. I am sure it will make a good effect. It is all to the point. I have a lot to do for the next few days or so but will write to you again after no 13 comes out I found that the oldest vignoble in all Provence is the Clos S. Patrice which it seems was the original name of the wine now known as Chateauneuf du Pape. It is very good. When you next come this side we will drink health in it and other wines. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
