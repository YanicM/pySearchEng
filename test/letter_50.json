I should like to sit down here at the fire by myself, but I have to go into town shortly to meet Mr Cosgrave. It is just possible that it may become fine by evening, and, if so, I shall expect you, but do not come out unless it is fine. I hope you are getting better every day. Have you found that place on the map? If we don’t meet tonight—tomorrow at 8. Jim",
