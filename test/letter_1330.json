  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: I have sent on your letter to my brother. I enclose a letter just received from him. It is clear that his one desire is to leave Trieste and Italy as soon as possible, at practically any cost to himself and for good. Therefore perhaps you could make your suggested motorrun to the school at Zug? In fact, any school whatever which can pay a small monthly [salary]. It is useful to reflect that my brother who now wishes to leave Italy as he finds life intolerable there was imprisoned for 4 years by the Austrians because of his rabid pro-Italian sympathies! I never took much interest in his politics and don’t understand the allusions in his letter to ‘anti-Joyce’. But if it is so, it is so. Und das ist mir ganz egal Friendly greetings to you both. Friendly greetings to you both sincerely yours James Joyce",
