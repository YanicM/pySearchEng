I hope the corrections for chapters III and IV reached you safely and that they are now forwarded to New York. When you are writing to me next I beg you to send me the May and June numbers of your paper if it be not too much trouble. I have had no letter from Mr Marshall but I suppose that you are now in communication with him and perhaps you know on what date he proposes to publish. With regards and thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
