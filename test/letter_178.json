  "text": "Dear Stannie Thanks for money. On advice of my lawyer I accepted Elkin Mathews terms. As for Long (not Lane as you write) I proposed that 3 of the stories to be chosen by me should be submitted either to Symons or Archer, if he needed assurance of their merit but that the report he spoke of would have no use or interest for me. I have a lot of papers for you parcelled up waiting for a favourable wind. Send the Belvederian, please!!! I am thinking of chucking the school and taking Danish lessons next month. By the way I can hardly reach the 31st. You might send me 3 lire (no more). Write on Saturday and put that amt of Austrian stamps in your letter: not 1d ones, of course. Damned if I see merit in Fumée. Am reading Mémoires d’un chasseur, But he is not Tolstoy’s height by any means. [Unsigned] The 3 lire will not inconvenience you and will do me nicely. Can you manage it?",
