(2) after Mr Deasy’s words ‘Ipaid my way’ for ‘Quite right. Quite right’ read ‘Good man. Good man’. (3) in Mr Deasy’s speech which begins ‘Mark my words’ omit the sentence ‘And now it has come’. Snowing here. Hope you got MS all right. Am at work now on last part of the Telemachia. My wife is mobilizing with the purpose of writing a letter to Mrs Sykes.",
