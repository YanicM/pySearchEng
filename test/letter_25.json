  "text": "Dear Mother, I am sending by this post to Mr O’Hara my interview with M Fournier. Did he get and insert my notes. I have paid my bill and can get on for two days more. No news from ‘Speaker’. Have any other reviews appeared in ‘Express’. Measure Stannie for my suit and have mine a little longer in the arms, leg 32½. A jacket (such as I wear at present) not any other kind of coat. I would prefer a blue suit. Send also a blue felt hat (to match)—the same shape as the one I wear now—Plasto’s, Brunswick St—no other kind. When you send the pudding make it into a strong-box-parcel, securely packed. It will be opened by the Douane and I don’t want it to come here half open. Tell Stannie to send me at once the March and April nos of ‘S. Stephen’s’ and a Holy Week Book—8°—large black print and no references (such as—‘see Psalm 13, p 104)—He will understand. When you send an order get it at G.P.O. before 6 o’c. I will explain later. Mr Casey says I owe him 3 frs more than I do. Send Holy Week Book in time for Tenebrae on Wednesday. Jim",
