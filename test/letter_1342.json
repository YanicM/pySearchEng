  "text": "Dear Mr Bergan: I am so sorry to hear your bad news that our old friend Mr Devin is gone. Only on Wednesday last I gave his name to a young American writer who is doing my biography and has gone to Dublin, Mr Herbert Gorman. I told him to see you and Mr Devin as you were the only people still left (as I thought) who could remember all the pleasant nights we used to have singing. Mr Devin’s song was ‘O boys, keep away from the girls I say’. The moral of it fell on deaf ears in my case and I dont think it meant very much to him either. He used to play the Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana—a version of his own and would have been a fine pianist if he had studied as he had a very agreeable touch on the keys. He used to collapse with laughter after a preliminary scream in a high tone at certain sallies of my father’s. He must have been a fine looking fellow when he was young and he had charming manners. He comes into Ulysses under the name of ‘Mr Power’ and also into ‘Dubliners’. I regret that my friend (who, by the way, is staying quite close to you at the Royal Hibernian Hotel) did not meet him and talk with him. He has letters to and from a number of literary people in Dublin. Many of them are very fair written too and one or two more than that but they never meant much to me personally and mean less now. The Lord knows whether you will be able to pick the Kersse-McCann story out of my crazy tale, It was a great story of my fathers and I’m sure if they get a copy of transition in the shades his comment will be ‘Well, he can’t tell that story as I used to and that’s one sure five!’ I hope you are well and send you all good and friendly greetings sincerely yours James Joyce",
