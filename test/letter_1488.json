  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: Ruggiero tells me you wrote me several times. I got one letter about ten days ago in reply to several cards. Many thanks. I have had a copy of my book sent to Prof. Diet but not to the other. I think the name of the critic in Berne is Riechner. An Italian review, Prospettive (Rome) published on 15 February an incomplete translation of Anna Livia together with several appreciative articles. Your news of your daughter does not seem so bad. I am glad to know you yourself are well and also that Prof. Vogt is flourishing and long may you both do so. My family is in pieces and in several places. As for me I cogitate therefore I exist. Kind greetings from us both sincerely yours James Joyce",
