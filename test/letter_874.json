  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver I have not leave to write but am sending this to wish you a very happy New Year. I have been having a poor time, more or less constant pain in the wound, allayed by aspirin and pilocarpin (antidote of scopo), no sight whatsoever and ‘blues’. Dr Collinson says he has not great hopes of it. Dr Borsch says I ought to see when the blood absorbs. It is doing so at about 1/20 of the normal rate. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Did you get H.C.E.?",
