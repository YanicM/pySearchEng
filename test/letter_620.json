  "text": "Dear Pound: I am all right again except for bad fits of neuralgia. This flat is frightfully dear but so was the hotel and there I had no ease in the cold sitting writing about tiresome Bloom with Mrs Pound’s shawl round my head and Miss Serruys’ two blankets round the rest of my body. Only for the gasstove in this flat I should be down with a full-blasted attack of the eyes. I must get over the winter some way and so I have asked Miss Serruys and Bradley to get me some lessons—a job I must take up again unless the hope in your letter is realized. That letter was rather a puzzle to me. Am I right in assuming that it is from Miss Anderson to you? I have heard nothing of Mr Wallace of New York but I had a letter from a Mr Wallace of Paris (who seems to be anything but a millionaire) he told me that a Dr Joseph Collins of New York had charged him to give £2 each to Giorgio and Lucia for Xmas—which was very kind of Dr Collins (unknown to me) but I take it this is only a coincidence of names. How the deuce can I take direct action in the matter if, as Mr XYZ who writes to Miss M.C.A. [says], the matter is to be ‘unknown’. I must wait, mustn’t I? A letter from the editor of N.Y. Evening Post sent on 1 September to an early Zurich address has reached me asking for contributions. Quinn’s secretary replied to my cable saying the trial is fixed for tomorrow and suggesting I cable instructions to withdraw but, apart from what I said already, the remaining episode Oxen of the Sun is already published as Miss M.C.A. (if it be she) states that a special triple number appears on 25 November. My idea therefore that the review had gone out of existence after the July number seems to be right. Is its revival now with 96 pages due to Mr Wallace and Mr Dorrance? How difficult it is to be informed correctly? In any case I shall wait to see effect of the new number and result of the trial after which I shall send on the Circe episode, now nearing completion, and wait to see what they do with it. I hope you [are] not suffering from neuralgia. It is a most boring thing. Of course there is no news here. I understand that Lugné Poe intends to do an adaptation of Exiles. A Mrs Yasushi Tanaka, introduced by you, is doing an article on Ulysses for the Pacific Review, published by the University of Washington. No news of the novel or of Budry, Fontanas &c or of Mrs Bloch. I do not even know where she is. Mrs Pound may remember that once in conversation with her I expressed a doubt as to whether Mrs Bloch had read the book. I have no news from Trieste either. They are a very friendly lot, I must say. Now I have a nice little incipient neuralgia so will end this. Kind regards from us all Sincerely yours James Joyce PS. The American ambassador’s name is Wallace, I find.",
