  "text": "[No salutation] Dr Paul Marquardt, Acquedotto 16, offers you a lesson between 7 and 9 p.m., four pupils and asks you to call. I take the opportunity of letting you know (as you have no doubt heard) that I am about to leave Trieste. Your friend Miss O’Brien (of London) has made copious apologies to me (whether for herself alone or for other I am not concerned to know) and I learn that your charges express tearful compunction. I intend to do what Parnell was advised to do on a similar occasion: clear out, the conflict being beneath my dignity, and leave you and the cattolicissime to make what you can of the city discovered by my courage (and Nora’s) seven years ago, whither you and they came in obedience to my summons, from your ignorant and famine-stricken and treacherous country. My irregularities can easily be made the excuse of your conduct. A final attempt at regularity will be made by me in the sale of my effects, half of which will be paid in by me to your account in a Trieste bank where it can be drawn on or left to rot according to the dictates of your conscience. I hope that your mind will be properly benefited by the barter you have made of me and mine against the aforesaid Cockney virgin and comfortress of the afflicted and the preoccupied Christographer of the Via dell’Olmo (on whom the editor of the Fortnightly Review will shortly wait in person) and that, when I have left the field, you and your sisters will be able, with the meagre means at your disposal, to carry on the tradition I leave behind me in honour of my name and my country. Jim",
