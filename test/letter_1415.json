For the moment we are not going to Switzerland. Perhaps later on. I had a visit from Mr Rich. Ofner (widower of the late Charlotte Sauermann, soprano at the Z’ch Stadttheater) whose son, a dentist’s Tekniker [sic], I am trying to get into U.S.A. You remember him? Good luck sincerely yours James Joyce",
