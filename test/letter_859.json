  "text": "Dear Mr Gorman: I hope you received the photograph I sent you. As regards the ‘broadsheets’ you mention I cannot reply until I see the exact text or a reproduction of it with details of type etc. I never give interviews and therefore your proposal in that direction leads me to suggest that it would be well if we could meet on other terms before you go back. I shall be very happy to give you any information I can on matters of fact or to let you see any documents or criticisms etc. We shall be in Paris on Sunday or Monday. I understand you should sail on the following Saturday. From where? If it is from a French port perhaps something could be arranged. Your letters are in my trunk on the way to Paris. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
