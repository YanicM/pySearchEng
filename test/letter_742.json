  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: In my haste I forgot to include the New York World cutting but now I would like to keep it for a day or two. It is a sensational cablegram saying that I am going rapidly blind and striving desperately to write letters a cubit high on a huge piece of cardboard measuring ten acres with a piece of carbon worked by a powerful dynamo. The tears of Americans are solicited for this blind tragic figure ‘in his Eiffel Tower apartment’. If they weep over him how loud will be their lamentations when another wireless message tells them that he is ‘out of his Eiffel Tower apartment’. Do you think it is possible for you to get for me (if not to buy, as a loan) a copy of Morgante the Lesser by ‘Sirius’ (pseudonym of Edward Martyn) published 1890? I should like very much to read it when I get to London. I am troubling you because in view of the date it is not a book which Miss Beach could order easily.",
