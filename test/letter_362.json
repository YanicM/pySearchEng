  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards Thanks for your letter of 14 inst. My reason for thinking that Mr Pinker was Mr Wells’s secretary is that Mr Wells in his letter to me spoke of Mr Pinker as ‘an old friend of mine’. Mr Pound also wrote me on the matter and suggested to me that as I live abroad it would be better for me to have an agent, literary and dramatic. Mr Pinker seems to be both: at least his notepaper bears that heading and his draft agreement which he sent me speaks of literary and dramatic rights. It is possible that your press clipping agency has overlooked the two notices in question. I shall perhaps write to my brother and ask him to search the files of the ‘Freeman’s Journal’ and of ‘Sinn Fein’. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
