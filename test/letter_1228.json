  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: This in reply to your letter of 27 ult. We were glad to hear all the exciting news and we want more. Giorgio should take some valerian before he sings. Do not be downcast if a lull follows. It is often like that and you cannot always rely on people’s pushing. But there was no doubt in my mind after 2 February last that Giorgio has a firstclass voice. I don’t want to criticize or advise you from here but are you not neglecting Pitt Sandborn. The press is very important and S. says he is the best critic of voices in America. When I hear of some definite result I think I shall write to MacCormack thanking him. I shall write to Giorgio separately. We have no news. As reports from Kusnacht are favorable we contemplate going back to Paris though I don’t like leaving Lucia alone for the Xmas. We tried for a small furnished flat here to tide us over but could not find one. My flat in Paris is of course only waiting to be occupied. The expenses are very high. Kusnacht is like Prangins 7000 a month and Jung’s bill for October was 3600. So hurry up as I want the loan of a million. Ask Colm to write to me. How is Mrs Colm? Did you see Soupault? Have you taken a flat as you spoke of doing? Mrs Jolas has not heard from you. The photos of Stevie are not good. Take a few more. I should like you to have a group taken. You don’t say what those radio stations pay. I am sorry to hear of MacSwiney’s death. He seemed to me a loyal and straightforward henchman of MacCormack. I gave him my ALP disc and he promised me McC’s record of Come into the Garden, Maud. Can you get this over there? You are having a great honeymoon over there, it seems. Send me a programme if you go to the opera. Is it opera? I hope you will have a pleasant Thanksgiving dinner next Thursday, is it? We are arranging to have the scar on Lucia’s face taken away and covered by a plastic surgeon here. This at her own insistent request. They say this is a good sign. The 7 November was the last day for the U.S. govt to appeal against the Circuit Court. Did they? Léon sent a cable to Cerf who did not reply, I understand that the English edition is being printed. The Gilberts have gone to London for some months to save money as Gilbert is terribly afraid the British Overseas Empire is going to capsize. Otto Kahn told me the Irish element in U.S. counts for nothing culturally. Have you not tried some Jewish melomaniacs? Please help me to draw up the invitation list for my approaching birthday. As everybody is everywhere I must arrange for a special aeroplane service. However, you can send the presents in the usual way. Please inform all your rich relatives about the date. Yes, that is a good idea. I am a little tired of wearing starched collars and I would like to try a diamond necklace. Did Jacques-Emile Blanche ever exhibit my portrait over there? I think it’s awful except for the splendid tie I had on. As you, Helen, write all the time about politics you ought to buy Slocombe’s book Crisis in Europe. In it he foretold the murder of the King of Servia. We met Huddleston in Geneva. He is afraid to cross in a ferryboat over the lake. Well, talk about scrambled eggs but what about this epistle. Tante belle cose and my regards to Mr Kastor Babbo",
