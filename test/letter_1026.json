  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: You did not send me any cuttings about my accident so I did not know what to correct. I was crossing the Esplanade des Invalides about 4 p.m. in a taxi alone and a private car ran into it. I was flung violently forward and then as violently back but escaped any glass in the eye. I had a big bump on my forehead and a bad pain in my back, but the doctor who examined me said there was no internal injury. Since I came back here my wife has been looking for a servant and I have been trying to extract money from publishers. Two of the three have now finally disgorged and I hope the third one will do the same…. Jouvet wants to put on Exiles. Sullivan to the relief of all my friends is leaving the Paris Opera in a fortnight. I was there for the reported last of Guillaume Tell the other night with Sir Thomas Beecham and Lady Cunard. The former told me in coming out that it was the most amazing tenor he had ever listened to, and wrote me that he had decided to do for him what he could in England…. Professor Vogt, I understand, does not want to operate me this month of which I am very glad as I do not feel up to it…. I understand from Miss Monnier that there is a big conspiracy on at the Nouvelle Revue Française to make a boost of Lawrence book Lady Chatterbox’s Lover, which is to be brought out in a form exactly similar to Lazy Molly’s ditto-ditto accompanied by a campaign of articles in papers and reviews, the publication to be in French. This scheme is what Bloom would call Utopian and I cannot understand how they can expect any sensible person to pay hundreds of francs for such a production when the genuine article much more effectively done can be had in any back shop in Paris for one tenth of the money. Carducci, Darius Milhaud and Antheil are setting pieces for Hughes’ book. The Rheinverlag wrote to Jung for a preface to the German edition of Gilbert’s book. He replied with a very long and hostile attack … which they are much upset about, but I want them to use it…. Can you ring up Gorman and ask him to find out whether Arthur Symons ever got my letter as I am not sure of his address. I have been very listless since that accident and will not write any more for the present….",
