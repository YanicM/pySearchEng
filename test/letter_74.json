  "text": "Dear Stannie I received your tardy letter with its budget of Cabra news. I enclose Chaps XII. XIII. XIV. I have finished Chap. XV and am now at Chap XVI. Send me all documents dealing with University College period from your diary &c. I should also like a translation (18/6d) Scott Library of Strauss’s Life of Jesus. I am ordering Renan. I want a long critical letter on these chapters. You may lend them as I said. Tell Curran I shall shortly send him a complete MS copy of my verses. I am waiting for the papers. I have written to ‘Speaker’ again and shall write also to Grant Richards and Baillie. This is our new room—very cosy stove and writing-desk. Return these chapters as early as you can. I shall not send others till the college episode is complete. Tell me about my literary friends—the theatre &c. I have no time to write you more now as I am hurrying back to a lesson. Nora has written to Aunt Josephine and again wishes to salute you. What the devil are you doing with yourself. Nora curls my hair up with a tongs—it is now properly en brosse. I look a very pretty man—O that nice old Henry James! Have you read his review on Baudelaire? It is damn funny. Jim",
