  "text": "Dear Mrs Barnacle: I wrote to my friend Mr Curran on Sunday week last I have had no reply yet. I wrote him very fully so perhaps he is making inquiries. As soon as I hear from him I shall write at once. Meanwhile I send a book illustrated by Lucia which I hope you will be glad to have as a proof of your granddaughter’s delicate talent. I thank you and Kathleen for your message of congratulation on the publication of Ulysses in England after my twenty years’ struggle. It is, I may add, the only word of congratulation which has reached me from any Irishman or woman at home or abroad.",
