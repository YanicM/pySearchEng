  "text": "Dear Elliot [sic]: Many thanks indeed for your kind word about my little poem. By all means dispose of it as you say though really it is Pinker who should do this. Anyhow it is as broad as it is long since I repay him his commission though you have all the trouble. The chief point is that you like the verse. Can you give me the address of Lady Otteline Morel [sic] and Sidney Schiff. I will tell you what I want it for in my next letter. It is really for my daughter I want it or rather for her publisher!!! Cerf offers me an advance of £700.-.- of 15% royalties for the American Ulysses, the publication to be immediate and he taking all risks. The text unabridged and unaltered. I hear there is an offer coming from Harcourt Brace and somebody else. There was another offer, same terms but with conditions from Morrow. I shall decide within the next few days. If there is no prospect of your firm doing a high priced private edition of Ulysses as was suggested that evening have you any objection if I ask Pinker to offer it in this way to Chatto and Windus who McGreevy tells me did something like this for a book of Proust’s? He says the Home Office took no steps against it. Will you let me hear from you as soon as possible as it is very important that Ulysses should appear in England while the other book is maturing. Harmsworth will bring out in May Duff’s book with a preface by Herbert Read….",
