  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have not stopped working yet but I had better send you off some news. Crosby Gaige’s successor Wells wrote for another fragment and I am trying to leave the city piece fit to submit to his agent here. I have finished however the work for Transition and also my connection with the review as you will see by a note in it. In addition to all this the German publisher arrived and wanted to rush me into a new contract, but I insisted on Goyert’s being brought here much to the latter’s displeasure in the beginning. He, Gilbert, I and Brody the publisher worked on the German text with the help of Sykes by correspondence…. He has now gone back and the first half of the book has gone to press and the second edition is to be out in December. Whatever the Germans are they are certainly quick…. As for domestic news, my wife has to be held down from assaulting different types of French civil and uncivil servants and we have to ring a bell every quarter of an hour to stop her from talking about London. Lucia turned down the Darmstadt offer and seems to have come to the conclusion that she has not the physique for a strenuous dancing career, the result of which has been a month’s tears as she thinks that she has thrown away three or four years hard work and is sacrificing a talent. In addition to which apparently she has to undergo an operation to straighten her eye. She wrote to Barcelona about her case and mine. The Spanish doctor, evidently a hidalgo, replied at length about her but almost completely ignored me as I suppose the case was too difficult to treat by letter. His terms are about three times as high as those of Paris doctors. There seems to have been a slight improvement while I was in England of my bad eye, which nobody can account for unless it was the result of Professor Euston’s treatment, the improvement being slight however. Do you think you could stand reading another sentence about my eye, because I don’t think I could write it this evening having just knocked off work on the city piece. An enormously long article appeared in the Harvard University Review and one or two others which Miss Beach will send you when she gets duplicates though these are not easy to find here. Have you seen an interview with Moore in the Sunday Times? I saw allusions to it in the Paris press but not it. He has written to me once or twice. I have received an invitation to lecture at Oxford but now that I have practically finished for the moment my work in progress (?) I am doubly disinclined to go. I shall write again in a few days when I get a rest. I knew we were both going to have a rather bad time when we left London lotusland but I hope you are enjoying all the delights of the countryside. I shall feel rather pleasantly stupid eight or ten days from now. The disc hasn’t appeared yet. I believe something went wrong in the factory, but it is expected any day. I suppose you read Bennett’s article on Alp, he will return to this again I think. Claudite iam rivos which is all the Latin that comes into my head at the moment. With kindest regards and begging you to remember me to my fellow sufferer Miss Marsden.",
