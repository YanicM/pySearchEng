  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: We have had a series of visits here, my brother (2 weeks), my sister (3 weeks), my wife’s uncle (2 weeks), Mrs Sheehy Skeffington, a Mr Sinclair from Dublin (v. Ulysses) and an almost daily succession of MM Orages. I have also had some curious encounters. Some concerts of music from Pound’s opera were given and several Antheil concerts about six. Requests for translation rights have come from Hungary, Poland and Czecho-Slovakia and Japan. The Japanese came to see me and was delighted with the japlatin I showed him in Ybc. I hope your sister is still making good progress. I am beginning to perceive dimly objects to the left of me. The progress is dreadfully slow but I think it is there. I send you a copy of The Day of the Rabblement but I prefer it to go tomorrow by registered post. It now fetches £7. I saw some letters of mine (in French) advertised in a catalogue at 5 gns and 3 gns. I cannot ‘place’ them. Protée has gone to the N.R.F. and Morel is doing a piece to appear in ‘900’ an international review coming out in Rome in French. Yabcd (no bids) has been offered to the Dial. I have done a piece of the studies, Z coaching Y how to do Euclid Bk I, 1. I will do a few more pieces, perhaps V picture-history from the family album and parts of O discussing A Pai (I would like to invent a satisfactory fountain pen!) A Painful Case and the T-U household etc. I will leave them in the rough when and if I go away. I ought to go but am afraid to stir. Lucia is in Deauville at the girls’ camp. My son is in an accountant’s office, pending the stabilisation of his voice. What have you learned in the hills about T, U, Z, Y, S, Q, V, M, O, N etc? It would be of service to me if you could jot down notes from time to time as ideas connecting them may strike you.",
