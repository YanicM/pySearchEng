  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards I am obliged to you for your letter and copy of the contract. If Dubliners cannot be published in May I should prefer September. I shall send you in a week or so the last story which is to be inserted between The Boarding-House and Counterparts so that you may proceed with the printing of the book. Being a first offender I cannot judge of the financial prospects of my book of stories. It seems to me, however, that if it had any sale in England you might perhaps be able to arrange an edition for America where there are some fifteen millions of my countrymen. You suggest that I should write a novel in some sense autobiographical. I have already written nearly a thousand pages of such a novel, as I think I told you, 914 pages to be accurate. I calculate that these twenty-five chapters, about half of the book, run to 150,000 words. But it is quite impossible for me in present circumstances to think the rest of the book, much less to write it. This novel also has the defect of being about Ireland. I shall be glad to hear from you again when you have decided in what form you will bring out Dubliners. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce.",
