  "text": "Prof. Vogt saw my eyes on Monday 10 July. He says I should have come to him before and is afraid it is now too late. The right eye was still operatable 20 months ago. Now the cataract is total and unfortunately complicated with glaucome (secondary) and a partial atrophy of the retina. I was wrongly advised, he says, to put an atropine in it which was pure poison. He says I must not even rub it. Retina and optic nerve were normal when he saw it in November 1930 but are not so now. He intends to observe it for some days and then decide whether he will allow it to go blind (erblinden) or attempt two very difficult operations in succession, the first early in September. In the latter course I may have to face a 5–6 months residence in Switzerland. This means a total cessation of work, a great deal of nervous tension and a considerable expenditure of money. I am writing to Vogt a letter explaining the events from April 1931 which prevented me from coming here to be visited and operated. He added that seeing the complicated condition of the neglected eye, he was reluctant to touch the other but that he would have done so had glaucoma and retinary atrophy not intervened in the other, resultant from interocular pressure unchecked [illegible word] by operation.",
