  "text": "Dear Stannie I spoke with the director today. Your route is London–Hamburg–Vienna–Trieste. On receipt of this or as soon after as possible you are to telegraph saying on what day you can definitely leave Dublin. Word the telegram so. Joyce Address—Berlitz School Trieste Communication—(for instance) Fourteenth (no signature) That will be five words only. ‘Fourteenth’ will mean that you can leave Dublin definitely on the fourteenth of this month. On receipt of your telegram I will send 100 crowns. The fare from Dublin to London is 29 crowns (£1—4—0). I do not know the fare (by steamer) from London to Hamburg steerage. This you must find out. The third class fare Hamburg–Vienna–Trieste will probably be 70 or 75 crowns (marks in Germany). However in Germany you can travel 4th class and thus save money. Let us say then (with this reduction for 4th class in Germany) the railway from Hamburg to Trieste costs you 65 crowns, and that the steamer from London to Hamburg costs you 15 crowns, the total cost will be:—  29  65  15 109 crowns I do not see what you want even with a portmanteau. I can give you collars and cuffs and ties until you can buy your own. But you must be well dressed. The dress Pappie says will do excellently or even a good new-looking black or dark suit would do with a good hat and boots. Instead of a portmanteau I would advise you to bring a big can of tinned meat and a knife (Jaysus! it’s like Buffalo Bill). You can buy bread at the stations or glasses of beer but eating there you would probably be swindled and I suppose you will not be able to afford that. The worst part is the long sea voyage. You will be perhaps 4 days travelling. Time your arrival in London so as to meet the boat for Hamburg. Get this information from Cook’s. The clerk who said 1£ probably was thinking of the Cape of Good Hope route. Be very careful of ticket-office clerks and trains. Talk French or English slowly to some responsible person until you are sure. If you are in a hobble anywhere telegraph to me. Of course you will have a hard time but your case is a damn sight better than mine when I left the North Wall (with Nora) for Zurich and had only the money to take us to Paris! Excuse the hastiness of all this but our family does everything at the eleventh hour. Follow the instructions of this letter literally. I don’t think (if you are well dressed) there is much fear of your being left like Toss. Bring your best certificate (and if possible your birth certificate) in your pocket or post them to me. Do not bring any of the MSS. Post them (registered). They are our only hope for the future. You will understand this letter if you remember the cursed stupid snobs who patronise these schools. I am writing in their language. More tomorrow. Jim",
