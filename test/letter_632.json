  "text": "Dear Mr Sykes: Four typists refused to touch Circe. At last came forward a young woman barrister who reads my books and she offered to do it in her spare time. The work went on slowly but surely. I hired a machine for her and she worked at it for an hour or so every other day. When she had done about half of it her father got a seizure (an incident, by the way, in the episode) and had to be driven home from the faculty of medicine where he is a professor. I spent a week or so looking for another typist. Now the proprietress of a small bookshop here says she will finish it, beginning tomorrow. I hope she will as it is very boring. The episode will run, I am told, to nearly 200 pages of typescript. It is as intricate as it is long. However, I hope to send it on shortly. Eumeus. The first episode of the close of the book much shorter about 30 pp and quite different, is also nearly finished; and I am, in fact, working at the second Ithaca. There remains to be written the last: Penelope. According to a plan submitted by Mr Quinn Ulysses is to be published in New York in June in a limited edition of 1500 at $12.50 a copy. Lugné Poë has had a big success with a farce by a Belgian writer Crommelynck, so that Exiles will scarcely appear before April, I hear. For the rest je m’en fiche pas mal. Little theatres and little reviews always go bust. Whereabouts are you going. I have taken this flat till June next. It is a princely apartment but frightfully dear. I took it only to enable myself to write the end of my book. After June Lord knows where we shall go. I send you copies of Comédie. May the black cat bring you good luck and if she (he) has kittens may one of them find a cheap flat for me. Kind regards to Mrs Sykes and yourself from all of us.",
