  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: Thanks for the copies of Lewis’s drawing. If it is not as good as others of his the sitter is at fault. We are sorry to hear you had such a stormy homegoing. The last part is amusing, but in retrospect only. I wish you better air luck. The Librairie Rouge et Cie of Lausanne would like to have a prospectus of the book. They bought the A.B.C. The name is is [sic] really Rouge. I mean it is not a symbol of any kind. I shall add in a postscript the address of W K Magee (‘John Eglinton’) if I can find it. He told me when I wrote to him some years ago that he believed he could get for me the music of Follow me up to Carlow about which—and The Lord in His Mercy be Kind to Belfast—about which I had written to him. The tune is alluded to twice, I think, in W i P. sincerely yours James Joyce PS 21 Carberry Avenue West Southbourne Bournemouth",
