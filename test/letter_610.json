Could you send me the Little Review for September and October 1919? Has any number appeared since the July-August number of this year? I mean has any part of Oxen of the Sun been published? I have received letters from New York concerning a prosecution. Have you received any letters from the New York editor? I should like to know before I reply. Kind regards from us all to Mrs Rodker and yourself Sincerely yours James Joyce",
