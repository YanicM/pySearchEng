  "text": "Dear Mrs Gorman: Do you know a Scotch shop in London which sells plaid ties? If so I should like you to buy me one and send it. The plaid I prefer (I think it is the Murray) has a lot of red in it as a ground and of course blue and white and yellow all over it. They made me buy a suit to go to Zurich in and I can’t find here a tie such as I want. Augustus John came here I think on Friday and I am to sit for a week so it seems we shall have left for Zurich when you come. You missed something on Friday night which you cannot ever have heard in your life and will never hear again. We were so sorry you were not with us. With many thanks and kindest regards to you both. Sincerely yours 4½d",
