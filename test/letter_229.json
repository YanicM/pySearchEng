  "text": "My dearest girl Tomorrow night (Tuesday) if I get money wired for I hope to leave here with Eva and Georgie. Now I have some news for you, my darling. My good friend Kettle is to be married on Wednesday and tonight I had a conversation of four hours with him. He is the best friend I have in Ireland, I think, and he has done me great services here. He and his wife are coming to Trieste to spend a day or two there during their honeymoon and I am sure that you, my darling, will help me to give them a good welcome. Put the house in order and be sure the piano is not lifted and see that your dresses are right. Get the carpenter to deliver that table and stools. He is a very good-hearted fellow and I am sure you will like his wife. Unfortunately I have no money to make them a present. But I will send on a copy of Chamber Music from London. Tell Stannie to take it to my binder and have it done exactly like the one for Schott and at once so that it will be ready when they come. We will try to entertain them the best way we can and I am sure that my warm-hearted girl will be glad to give pleasure to two people who are at the entrance of their life together. Will you not, dearest? And now about ourselves. My darling, tonight I was in the Gresham Hotel and was introduced to about twenty people and to all of them the same story was told: that I was going to be the great writer of the future in my country. All the noise and flattery around me hardly moved me. I thought I heard my country calling to me or her eyes being turned towards me expectantly. But O, my love, there was something else I thought of. I thought of one who held me in her hand like a pebble, from whose love and in whose company I have still to learn the secrets of life. I thought of you, dearest, you are more to me than the world. Guide me, my saint, my angel. Lead me forward. Everything that is noble and exalted and deep and true and moving in what I write comes, I believe, from you. O take me into your soul of souls and then I will become indeed the poet of my race. I feel this, Nora, as I write it. My body soon will penetrate into yours, O that my soul could too! O that I could nestle in your womb like a child born of your flesh and blood, be fed by your blood, sleep in the warm secret gloom of your body! My holy love, my darling Nora, O can it be that we are now about to enter the heaven of our life? O, how I long to feel your body mingled with mine, to see you faint and faint and faint under my kiss! Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight! Jim",
