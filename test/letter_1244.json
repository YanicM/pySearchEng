  "text": "Dear G and H: I sent round your books and original editions in a box marked B.O. to the rue Claire and will leave the key with your solicitor. The portraits have been renovated my father’s varnished and all insured. I will attend to this. Lucia went to London as Paris was too full of unpleasant memories for her and also to see Beckett. She met him a few times and they had dinner together. More anon, as Willy Shakespeare saith. Eileen is with her having got indefinite leave from her job in the Dublin ‘Sweepstake’. I pay her salary. They are living near Miss Weaver at the Ascot Hotel, York Street-Baker Street. Souppault just rang me up. I am to see him tomorrow at 5 p.m. He says you are having a festive time but it seems to me though you are both doing your best you are up against difficulties all the time and stupid people. Don’t be discouraged. Also don’t be annoyed at all the music I send. I know G. can’t sing it all over then and there but it is well to have it. I sent also the Cry of the Deer (S. Patrick at Tara), This consists of 1) the invocation of the Trinity (the shamrock) 2) the so-called Breastplate (Corazza) of S.P. a prayer to Christ. The former is good oratorio style, the latter somewhat tedious and theatrical. The composer’s real name is Harold White a Dublin man who wrote an opera called Shaun the Post. You don’t seem to go much to the opera. I hope you liked Siegfried with Melchior but I suppose if they put on Floradora with George Robey in the name part the horsehoers would not notice. I went to hear Rimsky’s Kittege again at the Opéra Comique with Zaporoyetz as Prince Yuri. Che splendore di voce. Ampia, estesa, facile e maestosa. Se Sullivan era il rei dei fort tenors, Z- è l’imperatore dei basses nobles, But he gets only a few hundred francs a night. Of course his voice is probably unsuited to many more flexible parts, Mephisto, for instance. And his part lasts about 10 minutes. But it is majestically beautiful, better than 6 years ago. I never met anybody in London who had even heard of him. So there you are. MacCormack is touring California and is to give a silver jubilee concert in N.Y., I think, on Easter Day. I also see that Mr Pinza, the bass, and Mrs are having some trouble probably over a Mrs Presnitz. This joke is lost on you, H, but ‘pinza’ is a gateau brioche and presnitz a kind of mince pie in Trieste. It is awful weather and it gives me cramps. A propos of the S.B. sale of my MSS (of which I am still officially ignorant) I am journalistically informed that the rumour is current over there that she, by her generous sacrifice of all her rights in U to me, resigned herself to abject poverty. Frailty, thy name is woman. Why don’t you send me a photograph of Stevie? I asked several times. But there is something you asked me for too and I forgot it. I got an offer from some impresario to make a lecture tour in the U.S. What on earth do these people want to be lectured to all the time about? Every old fool in Europe goes over to lecture to them about something or other. And they lap it up like soup. This is quite a different kind of flat from the Grenelle one: much more signorile but still simple. Big high rooms. My wife had to lengthen all the curtains. Also very quiet. Except for the squad of children upstairs. But that noise I don’t dislike. Still I hope someone makes them a present of a carpet or two. Tara era il Mecca o Gerusalemme degli antichi irlandesi. L’isola era una pentarchia = 5 re. Uno per ognuna delle 4 provincie, Ulster, Munster, Leinster, Connaught ed il quinto il re supremo (áɼd.ſí) era incoronato a Tara. S. Patrizio andò là a confrontare i preti druidici, come fece Moisè in Egitto. Fece ogni genere di miracoli anche. Ogni fuoco doveva spegnersi in Irlanda salvo il fuoco reale a Siane, credo. Patrizio suscitò l’ira dei druidi accendendo il fuoco pasquale. Era il sabato santo. I see the little Lord Mayor of Dublin Alfìe Byrne is going to N.Y. for the 17th. Every day I open the Irish Times I see him and his golden chain in some photograph or other. He has been Lord Mayor for 7 years but before him Mr ‘Larry’ O’Neill was Lord Mayor for 15 years. In my time the Lord Mayor was elected by members of the corporation to whom he owed money so that they could get a garnishee order on his salary. O yes I remember now. You said you had a film taken, isn’t that it and if I would like it. Yes, by all means. No, I don’t think Mme Jolas is angry with you nor the Gilberts. Sink both these little worries in the bosom of the Atlantic. Giorgio, so che canti stasera ma non so a che ora e come potrei udirti. Buona fortuna ad ogni modo. My wife is out but I send greetings from us both to G, II and S. Gradite, cari pargoli, i sensi dei miei più doverosi ossequi Babbo. P.S. Caro Giorgio: Ti mando le arie d’Oroveso e di Rodolfo. Non posso avere le altre oggi. Se questa serie di ‘broadsheets’ ti sembra interessante sottoscrivi. Accluso un ritaglio concernente il mobile conto. A quanto pare tutto va bene a Londra. Mandai Lucia da uno specialistica per le glandole. Pare abbia una defìcenza di secrezione adrenale. A parte ciò questo medico sostiene che lo scontro nel taxi c’entra per molto nel suo caso. Mandami buone novelle. Tanti saluti a Helen ed a Stevie. Ti abbraccio Babbo",
