  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I send you some new MS (Shem: Part I, vii), a piece I had omitted, a page to replace one typed and a fresh batch of typescript. I hope it will reach you safely. The fresh text follows after the words ‘Shem the penman’. I continue to work on, hopeless as the situation seems. What is to be done with your copy of the new edition of Ulysses? Is it not risky to send it by post? Mr Ford in the new Transatlantic Review is taking up the question of the Folkstone seizure which he hopes to bring under government notice, I think. I have consented to give him for the next issue the Mamalujo episode, the only sidepiece I could detach. The correspondent of Times here was appealed to and, having examined it, gave his opinion that it would not lead to prosecution for blasphemy. Mr Quinn sold the MS of Ulysses on 14 January. I waited for three days and then cabled. There was no reply. Several friends here cabled to New York but it was impossible to find out anything. At last after ten days a letter came from him saying he had sold the MS for $1975 ($25 under the minimum price he had fixed) and on the same day and at the same sale bought back two MS poems of Meredith (50 pp) for $1400. He added that the buyer Mr Rosenbach would pay in six months and said he would then send me a cheque for half the profit less auctioneers’ fees and not counting $9,– price of the covers in which the MS was laid. I replied declining to accept any money and asking what is Mr Rosenbach’s price for delivering up the MS. Apart from annoyance at being balked in certain plans I had made I consider such a sale now and by a wealthy man (who had made me part owner of the MS before the sale) a grossly stupid act which is an alienation of valuable property. It is a pity that I was obliged to write such a letter but what is one to do when a MS of 500,000 words is sold by an admirer who on the same day buys back a few pages of not very meritorious verse by a prose writer for almost the same sum? I hope you are still keeping well as the tone of your last letter was very discouraged. Perhaps the nightman sketch I send may produce by allopathy a mood of contentment. I am sending this c/o Miss Marsden to whom please give my regards. I hope the weather has improved over there as it has here—to a very slight extent only.",
