  "text": "Dear Stannie Tuesday I wired you today at lunch-time and am awaiting your reply. My funds are now 8d. If nothing comes I shall have to ask my pupil to lend me a lira as I am hungry. I have had no breakfast and read no papers for five days past but I could not spin out the money longer. I received a postcard from Grant Richards ‘I am sorry for the delay in writing to you definitely about Dubliners. I hope to do so within a very few days’. He is a damned hopeful man anyway. Do you remember his postcard of two years ago about Chamber Music. He said: ‘I shall hope to write to you very soon on the subject’? There’s hopefulness for you. I can write no more now because I am too busy thinking about the telegram and the chances of getting something to eat. Wednesday I received your telegram last night and your remittance today. Thanks. I had to borrow 5 Lire from my pupil last night on the strength of your telegram. As to my finances I have exactly 20 lire out of which I must pay this evening five to my pupil. I cannot wriggle beyond Sunday morning on this. If you can manage to send anything by wire then I can send you even Lire 100 on the first of October. That would leave me 150 L. 40 to the landlady, 10 trousers. However make the best suggestion you can. The least I will send you is Lire 50 and whatever remains over from your suit you can put in the bank. Why do you disapprove of my taking another pupil—if I can get one? My leisure is of little use to me and I want money. You cannot imagine I want to continue writing at present. I have written quite enough and before I do any more in that line I must see some reason why—I am not a literary Jesus Christ. However I shall hope that Mr Grant Richards shall perhaps also hope within a very few years to be able to see his way to make some communication to me regarding the unfortunately delayed MS which he admires so profoundly. What the devil do you expect I would write to Gogarty? I asked you to explain ‘Am I to acquire a villa for the natives?’ You know I am getting a little stupid: I don’t understand it. If I were sure that Mr Grant Richards would really hope to be able to print Dubliners I might have some reason to use Gogarty as an agent in advance. But really I believe Dubliners will only see the light when too late to give its author any pleasure. Yerra, what’s good in the end of The Lake? I see nothing. And what is to be said about the ‘lithery’ man, Ellis, and all the talk about pictures and music. Now, tell the God’s truth, isn’t it bloody tiresome? To me it is. As for ‘Rev Oliver Gogarty’ I think that may either have been laughingly suggested by O. St Jesus for his greater glory or hawk-eyedly intended by Moore to put O. St Jesus in an embarras. If the latter O St Jesus has risen nobly to the situation. I have violated the sanctity of this office by laughing. I remembered Moore’s legend about Mrs Craigie. Thanks be to Christ they amuse us anyhow. Re Joycetown: there is I am sure some place of that name in the neighbourhood he writes of. Thursday I find that instead of continuing this letter I must end it as I began. This is Thursday noon—a holiday here. I can live through today, tomorrow and the greater part of Saturday but cannot go beyond that. Let me explain. I got your 20 crowns yesterday morning: and had three in my pocket remaining from the night before = 23. Out of that I paid away 5 that I had borrowed from my pupil and 2 that I had borrowed from the landlady for the telegram 23–7 = 16. Yesterday 5½: 16 – 5½ = 10½. Today 5½ = 10½ – 5½ = 5. Tomorrow I must manage on 4, and that will leave 1 lira for a small lunch on Saturday morning. Now is that plain. Consequently unless you can telegraph money early on Saturday I have no means of living. You asked me to tell you how I stand. That is how I stand. As for my drinking I have rather too much to do. Last night when Nora went out to change the gold piece the landlady told her it was false. I was giving the lesson at the time and sent her with it back to the P.O. It turned out to be good French money but the suspense and toil of talking made me so sick that I couldn’t eat my dinner. So that’s how I stand. Kindly, if you possibly can, wire me money early on Saturday. You may rely on me for the 1st of October. I sent you the telegram because I had no idea that money was on its way to me and saw no means of getting any. [Unsigned]",
