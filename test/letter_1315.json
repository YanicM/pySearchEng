  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: Would the piece in this issue of transition with this initial suit you? You may keep the review in any case but I would ask you to return me the lettrine if you decide that the piece is unsuitable for your purpose. I fear it is. The copy I showed you of the Chaucer book was an advance one and as the book itself will not be out till the 10 August I enclose a proof of Louis Gilletâ€™s preface which you may like to read. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
