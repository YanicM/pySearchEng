  "text": "Dear Yeats I met my friend the other day and he asked me had I received from you the acting version you spoke of sending. I think it is better if you correspond with him direct. You can address: Nicholas Vidacovich Via della Cassa di Risparmio 13, Trieste. He still holds to his opinion about the earlier version of Countess Cathleen but says if you have any other play of yours which you think more fitted for the stage he will leave his translation of Countess Cathleen unfinished and translate it instead. I hope your negotiations may bear more fruit than mine over Syngeâ€™s Riders to the Sea. With kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Do you know of any publisher in London likely to take my unhappy book?",
