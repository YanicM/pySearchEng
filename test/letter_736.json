  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: These few lines will let you know that the conjunctivitis ended yesterday. No bad effects have followed. Dr Borsch thinks it is useless to prolong the dionine treatment (which, however, still does good) and so on Tuesday next I go into hospital. … I am rather sceptical as to the elimination of arthritis by removal of teeth or abscesses. However if it should turn out well I shall be the first to admit it. Everything depends on the success of Dr Borsch’s operation, it seems to me and as he thinks this other indispensable I consent to it. In spite of my eye attack I got on with another passage by using a charcoal pencil (fusain) which broke every three minutes and a large sheet of paper. I have now covered various large sheets in a handwriting resembling that of the late Napoleon Bonaparte when irritated by reverses. If my muddy mind is clear enough and if I can find a stenographer I shall try to send you the ‘exegesis’ of the Scylla and Charybdis episode before I go into hospital. I hope you got the Sporting Times. I enclosed it in a copy of a Paris theatrical paper lest its latent heat might evaporate. I think I got over this last attack (I hope it is the last attack) very well though I was frightened at the beginning. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
