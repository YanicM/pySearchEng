  "text": "Dearest Nora—Letter-writing is becoming almost impossible between us. How I detest these cold written words! I thought I should not mind not seeing you today but I find that the hours spin out very long. My brain seems to be very empty now. When I was waiting for you last night I was even more restless. It seemed to me that I was fighting a battle with every religious and social force in Ireland for you and that I had nothing to rely on but myself. There is no life here—no naturalness or honesty. People live together in the same houses all their lives and at the end they are as far apart as ever. Are you sure you are not under any misapprehension about me? Remember that any question you ask me I shall answer honourably and truly. But if you have nothing to ask I shall understand you also. The fact that you can choose to stand beside me in this way in my hazardous life fills me with great pride and joy. I hope you are not breaking all before you today. Perhaps you will relieve the slowness of tomorrow morning by letting me have a letter. It is only a week ago, you said, since we had our famous interview about the letters but is it not through such things that we have approached so closely to each other? Allow me, dearest Nora, to tell you how much I desire that you should share any happiness that may be mine and to assure you of my great respect for that love of yours which it is my wish to deserve and to answer. Jim",
