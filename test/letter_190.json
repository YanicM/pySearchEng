  "text": "Dear Stannie, This letter I shall probably put aside once or twice in order to dispatch postcards to you. I shall also steer clear of any financial details at least until I have got the other thing off my chest first. I may say however that I would hardly have taken the step I took had I not relied on A’s promise as a certainty: and moreover I understood from your letters that you had a great deal more to do than you could find time for. But let us ‘hasten away’ from that deplorable aspect of the case. I have come to the conclusion that it is about time I made up my mind whether I am to become a writer or a patient Cousins. I foresee that I shall have to do other work as well but to continue as I am at present would certainly mean my mental extinction. It is months since I have written a line and even reading tires me. The interest I took in socialism and the rest has left me. I have gradually slid down until I have ceased to take any interest in any subject. I look at God and his theatre through the eyes of my fellow-clerks so that nothing surprises, moves, excites or disgusts me. Nothing of my former mind seems to have remained except a heightened emotiveness which satisfies itself in the sixty-miles-an-hour pathos of some cinematograph or before some crude Italian gazette-picture. Yet I have certain ideas I would like to give form to: not as a doctrine but as the continuation of the expression of myself which I now see I began in Chamber Music. These ideas or instincts or intuitions or impulses may be purely personal. I have no wish to codify myself as anarchist or socialist or reactionary. The spectacle of the procession in honour of the Nolan left me quite cold. I understand that anti-clerical history probably contains a large percentage of lies but this is not enough to drive me back howling to my gods. This state of indifference ought to indicate artistic inclination, but it doesn’t. Because I take about a fortnight to read a small book. I was about two days making up my mind to go and see the Dusk of the Gods. I weighed the cold, the distance, the crush, discomfort &c. Finally I went and tried to interest myself but was considerably bored. The fault, I believe, is more mine than Wagner’s but at the same time I cannot help wondering what relation music like this can possibly have to the gentlemen I was with in the gallery. By the way both the banker and his brother seem to be well educated yet I have never heard them discuss anything except the whereabouts of the ‘blaues Heft’ (the book in which the exit of bonds is noted) and of the ‘rotes Heft’ (the book in which the entry of same is noted). I have been trying to read Carducci’s verses, induced by the fact that he died unfortified by the rites of R.C.C. But not only does it not interest me: it even seems to me false and exaggerated. I dislike Italian verse. I find Italian men lacking in delicacy and virility. They are intelligent as a rule and clever but babyish. Of delicacy neither their men nor their women have a scrap. I don’t so much object to its absence in the latter. The day of Bruno’s memorial procession I was standing among the crowd waiting for the cortege to appear. It was a murky day and, being Sunday, I had not washed. I was wearing a white felt hat, faded by reason of heavy rains. Scholz’s five crown cloak hung bawways on me. My boots, being Sunday, were coated with a week’s dirt and I was in need of a shave. In fact, I was a horrible example of free thought. Near me were two good-looking young women, females, of the people, that is. They were in charge of an elderly woman and a middle-aged man. They were low-sized and quince-coloured in the face with amiable dog’s eyes. One of them had a trinket on a long chain and this she constantly raised slowly to her lips and rested it there, slowly parting them, all the time gazing tranquilly about her. I watched her do this for quite a long time until I perceived that the trinket was a miniature revolver! I tried to explain my sensation to one or two Italians, narrating the fact as best I could. They saw nothing strange in it or typical or significant. One of them told me that many Italian women wear a cazzo as a trinket and after that they talked to their heart s content about cazzo and Co—a topic which, m my opinion, it requires a great deal of talent or else a great deal of courage to render in any way interesting. When I enter the bank in the morning I wait for someone to announce something about either his cazzo, culo or coglioni. This usually happens before a quarter to nine. I received yesterday a letter from John Long in which he said that his reader had advised not to print the book and &c &c. So Dubliners is once again roosting on my shelf. By the same post I received from Elkin Mathews the proofs of Chamber Music. It is a slim book and on the frontispiece is an open pianner! Shall I send you the proofs to correct. I don’t know whether the order is correct. I don’t like the book but wish it were published and be damned to it. However, it is a young man’s book. I felt like that. It is not a book of love-verses at all, I perceive. But some of them are pretty enough to be put to music. I hope some-one will do so, someone that knows old English music such as I like. Besides they are not pretentious and have a certain grace. I will keep a copy myself and (so far as I can remember) at the top of each page I will put an address, or a street so that when I open the book I can revisit the places where I wrote the different songs. I am sorry you have not written about the Abbey Street row. I leave here for an unknown destination either the 15th or 30th of next month. I have written to various agencies and advts in different parts of Italy and France. But I would like to get out of Italy, if possible. I laughed at Eglinton and his cake but I fear I have eaten nearly all mine: still his must be a trifle stale by this. I would like to live in a warm town by the sea where I could write and think at leisure. Marseilles is not a tourist place but a port like Trieste and I chose it because it is cheap to get at, lively, good climate and must be cheaper than Rome. Besides the Italian colony there is 100,000. I detest office work. I would prefer even work in a shipping office at a harbour where I could go in and out. After all I must be worth something, even commercially. I know three languages very well and two others passably well and with Greenham and Sanguinetti and here in Rome I have had ‘experience’ and I have written for ‘Fortn. Review’ ‘Sat. Review’ ‘Speaker’ ETC. I sent you today one of the proofs of the verses to see if the order is correct. The other I have corrected and sent back. I have answered several advts and hope to be able to get some position in which I can find the heart to go on with my writing. It seems to me better to try that line as it might bring me money. As for Nora and Georgie it seems to me easy to exaggerate. I suppose it will hardly come to starvation point. You seem to imagine that I should settle down to make myself a carriera here, beginning at 250 frs a month and ending 20 years hence at 450 frs a month, with all the accompaniments of such a carriera, a quarter, a servant, children at school, a small bank a/c and a great fear of everything in me. This is what I should do but I doubt very much if I will ever do it. We will see. Whatever happens it will hardly come to me as a surprise. I have changed a few verses in Chamber Music and have, that is, allowed my later self to interrupt the music, perhaps improving the poem as in the case of the Mithridates one. But the verses are not worth talking about: and I begin to think neither are the stories. [Unsigned]",
