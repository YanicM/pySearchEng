  "text": "Dear Sir: It is now three years since you published Chamber Music and I would be glad to hear if the sales have brought in anything to my profit. Therefore I would ask you to send me an account to date by return. When I was in Belfast last autumn Mr W. Reynolds, musical critic of the Belfast Evening Telegraph, gave me some settings he had made of certain of the songs and complained to me that you had refused to give him permission to set them. Illness and various business prevented me from writing you earlier on this matter. I cannot understand why you did not give him leave. I had a letter today from Mr Oâ€™Brien Butler, the Irish composer of the opera Muir gheis, who writes that he admires the verses very much and will perhaps set some of them. Should he write you thereon I do not see why such permission should be withheld. I was told in Dublin that a Mr Hughes had also done some of the songs and one has even been set by a young Italian musician here. Seeing that no fewer than five composers seem to have been at work on the book and in the light of the press notices which were all very favourable, I am quite at a loss to understand how the book has brought me in nothing so far. I will ask you for a line in reply and trust it may be of an encouraging nature. Perhaps it will interest you to know that my long-delayed book of stories Dubliners will come out in Dublin early in June published by Messrs Maunsel.",
