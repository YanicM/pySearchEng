  "text": "Dear Budgen: If this reaches you by S. David’s Day this is to wish you many happy returns. I have just read a long article by Mr K. Blistra in the Rotterdamsche Courant (eng. edition) 3 Feb. ‘Woorden aan den Rekstok’ (‘Words on the Rack’) about my book. If Mrs Budgen is from that city maybe she knows him. The article is not very favourable but it is sincere and intelligent. Perhaps he could have your article put into Dutch and published in some Dutch review. It would not pay as well as the Fortnightly but since that is paying nothing? Anyhow, I hope you will have lots of fun at. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
