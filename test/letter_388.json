  "text": "Dear Yeats At its last meeting the committee of the Royal Literary Fund voted me a grant of £15, payable in three installments of £25 each at intervals of three months. I am very much obliged to you for the trouble you took in the matter. I hope I shall soon begin to receive something for the books I have written or at least be able to live independently as I did until a few months ago. Both these possibilities seem rather remote at present. I trust your health is good and that you are as well as can be expected in these ‘calamitous times’. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
