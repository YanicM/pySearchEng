  "text": "Dear Miss Bollach: After our interview the other evening it seems to me very unfair of me to have inflicted on you such difficult work. It is very kind of you to undertake but I think you are doing so at too great a sacrifice. The text must be impossible for a foreigner and I ought to have known it. However as you are doing this piece may I ask to make this one addition? On the last page of the prose part (before the verse begins) after the words ‘oremus prayer’ and before the words ‘for navigants etc’ please insert these words: ‘to Peregrine and Michael and Farfassa and Peregrine’ With many apologies and kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
