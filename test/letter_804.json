  "text": "Dear Yeats: Many thanks indeed for your very kind letter of 5 instant. I am sorry that I am again obliged to decline your invitation but unfortunately I have just undergone another eye operation (the third) and the result will not be known for a few months. I must then return to Paris to have my sight tested and I am not yet sure where I shall be in September and October. Let me thank you for your intervention in my favour with the committee you mention but, more than for that, for the expression of friendly admiration with which you have honoured me. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
