  "text": "Dear Miss Guillermet: Since you write English so well I suppose I can answer also in English. I hope you have now received safely the books I sent you registered, your own novel and my play signed. I read your novel with much interest though I do not like the epistolary form in which you have written it. It is seductive but has the inevitable drawback that one can see only from one angle. The inclusion also in some of the letters of literal transcripts from ‘l’autre’ is a device, necessary no doubt, which dissatisfies. The only successful attempt in that line which I have seen is Merimée Abbé Auban where the last letter completely turns the scales the other way. But every form of art has its limitations and it is better to judge a book by what it achieves within its limits. Your book reminded me somewhat of Amiel who, I imagine, must be a favourite with you. What tiresome critics call the ‘plot’ seems to [me] to be suffused by a sentiment very rare in French literature. I mean the Huguenot strain which is apparent for example in Mr Gide La Porte Etroite a book with which yours seems to me to have some analogy. Perhaps you will think this judgment fantastic but you must allow for the fact that after all I am a foreigner. I suppose you yourself (for more reasons than one) are displeased by the end of the book. Artistically however it seems to me a completion rather than an interruption. I am sorry I cannot keep the novel as you have no other copy but ‘épuisé’ is a very pleasing word to a writer’s ears. I send you some more notices of my Portrait which may interest you but like most writers (and mothers?) I am thinking chiefly of my latest work. After your rather scathing attack on my ‘manque de goût’ I am waiting with some trepidation for your criticism. As I seldom read papers I shall be very much obliged if you will send me three copies of the issue in which it is published, one for myself and one each for my English and American publisher. I envy anyone who writes in French not so much because I envy the resources of that language (whose function I find to be for the most part a standard of moderation and criticism rather than one of innovation) but on account of the public to which one can appeal. Writing in English is the most ingenious torture ever devised for sins committed in previous lives. The English reading public explains the reason why.",
