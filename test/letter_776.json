  "text": "Dear McAlmon: There is no chance of my getting away and the legacy bore is still hanging on. Is it possible for you to make an arrangement as before which I would then settle on next quarter day (25 March). We are still 5 weeks off that and I am again pressed. I cannot write to Miss Weaver first because the matter is out of her hands and also because she is staying with Miss Marsden now and I don’t think she likes the tone of my last effusions though Larbaud to whom I read it thinks they are the strongest pages I have written. The task I have set myself is dreadfully difficult but I believe it can be done. O dear me! What sins did I commit in my last incarnation to be in this hole? I hope you are enjoying yourself down there. You ought to visit the walled town of Vence (Station Cagnes). If you do call on A. Kerr Bruce, Le Petit Mas. He will give you a good Scotch and soda. If you see them give them our regards. I like Cannes too especially to drive (horse not auto) round the bay. My sight is not very good today as the weather is changing. So I shall end this. Of course I never heard or saw anything of Princess Murat since. I am not able to do these jobs and write in the half dark at the same time. Please remember us to Dr and Mrs Williams. Kind regards to yourself and many thanks sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Ulysses is selling very well but I don’t care to bother Miss Beach.",
