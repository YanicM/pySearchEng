  "text": "Dear Mrs Gorman I return with this A.S.’s letter and enclose one from my Scotch cousin who may be yours also. My wife wants to know if you could see the place she writes of so that we might form an idea about price etc. Her idea now is to have a summer residence in London so as to avoid the hundreds of pounds I spend yearly in hotel bills there. I cannot get any satisfaction about that A.L.P. disc and I wish Mr Gorman could bring the matter up in conversation if and when he meets T.S.E. The idea was Ogden’s but he is now quite off it and a sale of 5 discs a year is absurd. I hope you are over your indisposition by now. Sullivan will sing Guillaume Tell for the last time at the opera on 8 and 17 instant. Is it likely you can come. I have put off my Zurich operation till after that. At last I got Beecham and Lady Cunard into the theater last week to hear him. B told me after the opera it was the most amazing tenor voice he had ever heard and that he would do all he could for him in London. Thank Mr Gorman for his letter. I can write this but not see it well and I hope you can read it. My eyes were not injured in the taxi crash, thank goodness. Kindest regards to you both from 4½d J.J.",
