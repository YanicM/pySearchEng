  "text": "Dear Mr Alonso: Many thanks for your kind letter. As regards the Spanish title of my novel, from what you say it seems better to use the word Adolescente. As you say the Spanish Joven is impossible. Nevertheless, I believe that the classical meaning of adolescence is a person between the ages of seventeen and thirty-one and this would cover only the fifth chapter of the book and represents about one fifth of the entire period of adolescence, whereas in English at least, while the word adolescent is quite inapplicable to the person represented in chapters 1, 2 and even 3, the term young man can be applied even to the infant on page one, of course in joke. What is the usual description of selfportraits made in youth used in the catalogue of your Spanish picture galleries? The word autoritrato seems to me an insufficient description of a picture. The title of the French translation which I sent you, in order that you may consult it on doubtful points is taken from the catalogue of the Louvre. As regards your question, please refer in all cases to the French translation. I did not revise it but I helped the translator a good deal. I hope you will let me have a copy of this Spanish version when it comes out. If you send me your copy of the English when you have finished with it I shall be very happy to sign it for you, if you would like to do so. Sincerely yours, James Joyce P.S. Will you please address your reply to me here in Paris and not in Arcachon. J.J.",
