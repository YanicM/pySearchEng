  "text": "Dear Pound: I have just wired you: Cable Quinn confirm or remit you telegraphically nothing here remitting. You wrote on 17 July you had a letter from him to say he had sent me an advance on the MS of my play. I take it that letter from New York must have been dated 8 July or thereabouts. It is now 20 August. No money has arrived here and on inquiry at the telegraph office I hear that none has arrived there either. There must be some miscarriage or mistake which had better be cleared up. I remit you 6/– cable expenses. If insufficient be sure to deduct the rest from what is remitted for me. Am sorry to hear you have been so overworked. As regards myself I am sorry to say that my health has again taken a bad turn. On Saturday when walking in the street I got suddenly a violent Hexenschuss which incapacitated me from moving for about twenty minutes. I managed to crawl into a tram and get home. It got better in the evening but next day I had symptoms of glaucoma again—slightly better today. Tomorrow morning I am going to the Augenklinik. This climate is impossible for me so that, operated or not, I want to go away next month. I am advised to go to Italian Switzerland. There are other reasons also for going. It will be, I fear, very difficult to keep these rooms heated during the bad Zurich winter and it becomes more and more difficult to get different articles of food so that I think my best plan is to move into some cheap pension down there. I shall do this if Mr Quinn’s money arrives and if there is a prospect that your suggestion of some months ago will become a fact; I mean about Ulysses. You suggested that it could appear serially in Egoist and Little Review and thus bring me double fees. I am prepared to consign it serially from 1 January next, instalments of about 6000 words. It will be necessary for me to replace in some way the lessons I forfeit by going away from here. The subvention I receive from my unknown and generous benefactor is now 350 instead of 420 frs a month owing to rate of change—equivalent in purchasing value to 250 frs in normal times. It is most useful of course and but for it I should be in the poorhouse but I need to supplement it. Let me know whether this plan of yours is still feasible. I hope it is. My agent has considerable difficulty with Mr Richards about the publication of my play. He (Mr R.) disposed of the remainder of Dubliners as waste paper in America and is now bringing back his own copies to save trouble of having a new edition brought out. Mr Archer wrote you sent him copy of my novel. He says he cannot read it: too depressing. He can read only detective stories, he says. Is he ill? Shall finish now. Please do not be alarmed about me. My sight is a little weak today but I shall get over it as I got over other things. I did not receive your verses or those of Mr Eliot nor even my own With kindest regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
