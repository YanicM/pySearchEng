  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: … I suppose you now have transition 8. Since it came out I have woven into the printed text another 152 rivernames and it is now final as it will appear in the book except that I cannot get the way to render this in the annals ‘On this day the Liffey at Essex bridge was completely dry for two minutes’. I asked Miss Beach to send you Two Worlds in which Roth jeers at my gibberish which he booms in his advertisements as tremendous. My state of exhaustion still continues but then I put in three more days on U since my last letter and in fact I have been obliged to write to the editors of transition to ask them to omit me from the next number. The latest Irishman to ring my bell is ‘Cranly’ of the Portrait etc! The ‘Lynch’, he tells me, of the Portrait and Ulysses was fished up out of the Thames some months ago. He seems to have come from Ireland to see me, has never been on the continent before, can’t speak any French, has seen nothing in Paris and returns to Ireland after a stay of three days. I had a rather strange dream the other night. I was looking at a Turk seated in a bazaar. He had a framework on his knees and on one side he had a jumble of all shades of red and yellow skeins and on the other a jumble of greens and blues of all shades. He was picking from right and left very calmly and weaving away. It is evidently a split rainbow and also Parts I and III. And now may Allah who is infallahble guide this epistle of his lowliest and shed upon his sconce the quietude of the carpetweaver.",
