  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for your two letters. I shall be obliged if you will forward a copy of Chamber Music to Mr Huebsch and also the press notices which I enclose. I agree to your proposal of an article with a woodcut but fear that your readers have already had enough of me. In any case tomorrow I shall send photographs, one for the Egoist and one for Mr Huebsch. As regards the ‘biographical items’ which he requires will you kindly refer him to Who’s Who? (1916) and forward him also a copy of The Egoist (15 January 1914)? I send also some account of my books on the enclosed slip as I suppose that is what he means.",
