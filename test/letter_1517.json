  "text": "Dear Mr Brauchbar I received on 28 ult your cable of 26 ult and replied: and on the 7 inst your letter of 26 ult with your short cable address. Today I received the letter overleaf dated 24 ult. I have not received the letter of the 16 ult and I have not received any money from Marseilles or anywhere else or any other letter. I send you this letter without any comment. It does not need a reply. I wrote three or four letters enclosing copies of yours of last month to your son at Zurich but had no reply from him. I also wrote to Zumsteg who gave me the address of a lawyer, Mr Georges Haldenwang, 6 rue du Rhone, Geneva who, he wrote, for a lawyerâ€™s fee of 200 frs Swiss would be able to get my request for entry through the Berne Department within a month. Otherwise it might take 3 or 4 months. He said the Federal authorities would ask for a collective guarantee of 50,000 frs Swiss. I made the request and wrote to the lawyer 5 weeks ago. There is no answer: but one of my Zurich references (I gave 5: Vogt, Schoeck, Prager, Moser, Giedion) writes that on enquiry at Berne it was learned that the leave to go to Zurich would not be easily obtained. It is also by no means sure that we shall obtain from the French authorities permission to leave. My daughter has the German permission but I have no funds to pay her doctor with (Dr Achille Delmas, 23 rue de la Maine, Ivry s/Seine, Paris). I have a place for her to go near Lausanne. Mr Zumsteg said that if I got the permission for Switzerland and needed funds to travel he would advance these and I could repay his father at Zurich. I have written the U.S. Legation at Berne to find whether I shall have the same difficulties with the State Department if and when I reach Switzerland. Many thanks to you in any case. James Joyce",
