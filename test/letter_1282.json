  "text": "Dear Lucia: I am very glad that you have already started the cure of glands with Dr M. and I have almost the conviction that he will be for you what Vogt has been for me. That is to say the man who does his business and comes at the end of a series of ‘botchers’. For the moment it is up to you to do what he will tell you. Leave Ireland alone and the rest of the universe and think only of getting better. The cure is short and seems certain. It is divided into two periods of approximately 4 and 3 weeks. Altogether 35 injections divided in 15 and 10. Between the two I suppose you will go to the country. You could have done the cure in Dublin but there were 2 principal obstacles: 1st yourself it seems wrote a letter to Miss Weaver that you wanted to go to Sussex because Bray was beginning to tire you. And also there is not in Ireland a specialist for the glands (endocrinali), they are backward in that respect. I don’t mean by this that you must consider you [sic] ties with Ireland finished or your voyage there and your stay there as fruitless. But the flower that is born from our land takes some time to grow and one does not see immediately the true and real sense of proceedings. I see you standing on the bridge of the boat and sending your farewell to the land that vanishes and your movement gives me a profound sensation. It certainly means something but I am not sure what. Perhaps that which it seems. Perhaps also not. I will think, I will think again. I am slow O yes 8 years to write a book and 18 for its successor. But I will understand in the end. In the meantime I will tell you a piece of news. Rog Neel when he left the gulf of Dublin was an excellent ‘diver’ and when the storm came he remained for a moment under the water. 3 years are a moment in the life of an ocean. And then again puff! he remounted the salty water full of weeds and smiling happily. But why was he smiling? Hear why. When he was down there in the world of the sea he made the acquintance of an excellent fish, his teeth glimmering out of his mouth and he presented the fish with his visiting card [inscribed] his faithful friend Rog Neel. And Rog Neel at the summit of the task lifted 3000 silver buttons from his jacket and offered them with his visiting card to that good paste of a fish. And when he returned to the light of the day (it was a little black down there) he took the visiting card and read: Doct. George Arago, dentist and surgeon, 12 bis avenue MacMahon, Paris, telephone number Etoile 14.01. And the fish took the paper of his friend and wept 3000 tears, 1 for each button and he attempted to read but the light was faint and his eyes veiled poor fish! He did not distinguish well was it Jacky Jakes or Jicky Jones or Jaky Jeames so help me you! And that is why he wrote Rog Neel with all his 30 and more than 30 teeth transparent….",
