I will sell only the dummy copy of the first edition. I think part of the Dubliners MS is Dublin work. I have also a heap of MS in Trieste that I forgot all about until this instant about 1500 pages of the first draft of the Portrait of the Artist (utterly unlike the book). I will ask my brother to send it also and you can have it with pleasure. I think I will put a shop price of $400 on the dummy as Yeats says it would be valuable and not to sell it cheap. Rosenfelt will have to pay it all together or I will not sell it. Can these words be still cut on the plate after (as sung by Phoblocht) (the second exclamation made upside down)",
