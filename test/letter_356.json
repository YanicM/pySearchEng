  "text": "Dear Mr Mencken: I am in receipt of your kind letter of 3 instant. Although I am still living at the address to which your letter was sent and although it reached me quite safely I think it better to reply to you from above address and beg you to send your reply also in the same way. You will easily understand the reason of this rather complicated arrangement. I am pleased to hear that two of my stories appeared in your magazine. Could you perhaps send me a copy of the number in which they appeared? I thank you also for your good opinion of my book. I gather from your letter that an American edition of Dubliners has been published. Will you please tell me what is the name of the American publisher? I have been cut off from communication with my English publisher since the outbreak of the war and know nothing of this new new edition. A novel of mine A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man has been running in The Egoist (London). The last instalment will be published, I think, next month. If you wish to consider it Mr Pound or the editor of The Egoist will be able to give you what information you need. I hope it will come out in book form before the end of the year: but possibly its serial publication in the way you suggest might be arranged so as to be completed before the date of the English publication in book form. I thank you also for your kind offer to help me to an American audience and hope you will forgive me for asking you to send me the information I desire as it is rather difficult for me for the moment to obtain it in the usual way.",
