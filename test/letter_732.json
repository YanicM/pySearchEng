  "text": "Dear Larbaud: Thanks for the copy of Echantillons which I shall now try to read with my back to the light—and also for the kind dedication. I am sorry you were not with us the other night and hope your health is better. I am well enough except for my sight. No fewer than three operations to be faced and of course I have been putting it off. But I shall begin next week. An Italian version of Ulysses modelled on yours is to be brought out in Rome as soon as possible so when your work and health allow could you let me have a copy of your plan, e.g.— Telemachia I (entire) II (recension) III (fragments) etc In this way the two versions would be similar though not identical since recensions would differ and the fragments chosen could hardly be the same. I hope you approve? Sincerely yours James Joyce",
