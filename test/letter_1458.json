  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: I am glad to hear from you and to know you are well and cheerful. We had to come up here in a hurry from La Baule owing to a very serious illness of my daughter-in-law and are stopping in this hotel as all the flats in our house are unoccupied and of course unheated. I don’t know when we shall be able to return so if you run over here please ring me up. I did not send the Barrie book to the U.S. after all. With thanks for your good wishes in these tiresome times and with my own good wishes to you and your family sincerely yours James Joyce",
