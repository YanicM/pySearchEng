  "text": "Dear Larbaud: Of course you are to have the casting vote in all discussions. I agree with every word of your letter to Miss Monnier. The German translation came out on Tuesday last. I could not write a line on Svevo—or anything else. I have just finished revision of Anna Livia for transition no 8. What a job! 1200 hours of work on 17 pages. She has grown—riverwise—since the night you heard her under the sign of Ursa Minor. Her fluvial maids of honour from all ends of the earth now number about 350 I think. I hope to see you soon here. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. And now for your address???",
