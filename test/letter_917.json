  "text": "Dear Pound: Thanks. That declaration ought to be enough. I cannot understand what she is doing (J.H.). We have cabled several times and can get no answer. I assume she is trying to help me but she is really impeding my case. The whole affair is a most dreadful bore. They say Conner is a very competent lawyer. The lawyer who sent me the offer from Roth wrote again this morning. R. apparently circulated the rumour that he had compromised the case with me so I had a cable sent denying that also. I enclose Collinsâ€™s reply to Wallace which has just come. I hope it is of some use. By the way will you please send me back Yabcd, registered. I want to try to have it copyrighted in America. I am publishing the first pages of the book (Yabcd is Part 3) in a Paris review. When is the first number of Exile to appear? I hope Mrs Pound and yourself are well. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
