  "text": "Dear Miss Beach: I hope you will have a pleasant time. Here it rains and rains! The Anna Livia sign is a simple equilateral triangle or delta U. Before you go can you make the few more changes enclosed and also order that interesting book. Will you leave U with Miss Moschos in case I think of anything else? I hope you won’t have storms. What a summer! I sent the photo to L.M. Did you send Criterion to Pound and Larbaud? I think I promised it but 2 Square Robiac drove a lot out of my head. Also has V.L. Contact selection. I have a rather large change to make on the fourth last page of Z so I hope Walsh sends me the proof quickly as I want to banish the whole Earwicker family from my mind. I am sorry to give you trouble again at the last moment but it is a disturbed time. Give my best wishes also to Miss Monnier for a pleasant holiday With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce U",
