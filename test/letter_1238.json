  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: I have been all the afternoon with Mr Hans Curiel, ex stage director Berlin Opera now Corse Theatre here, trying to get the songs on paper amid noise and rehearsals etc. I hope they are all right. Keep the discord F# A C E against the voice singing G natural in the middle of Yellow Ale only and end the last verse of this song with the major chord, singing E (I think, have no grand piano in this bedroom). Lucia came in and had lunch with us in the hotel on Xmas Day. Of course we had turkey and ham and plum pudding and they drank some champagne which I sipped it being the daytime. Everybody seemed to be struck by her grace and charm. She was all dressed up and powdered and perfumed. Then we went for a drive. On Boxing Day she came in again and we went into a music room in the hotel where she sang a great deal mostly all my Irish songs to my Liszt-like accompaniments. She has just sent us 2 presents for New Year, a plant of lilies for her mother and a bundle of virginia cigars for me. If you honour the diamond horseshoe with a visit please send me a programme. I hope you had a merry Xmas and that there is plenty of bicarbonate of soda in New York. I shall try to get Curiel to put down 2 of my songs Bid Adieu and Take, O Take them Lips Away (words by Shakespeare). This latter is my own favourite. The person who sings the Yellow Ale must be a rather elderly or even old man for the ‘no right man’ at first thinks or pretends to think she is his daughter. The phrase ‘no right man’ in Anglo-Irish means ‘eerie, inhuman’. The Irish fairies (Ir. feaɼ siḋe = men of the hills, they are supposed to be an older race who were driven to live in the hills, inside the hills, by a later comer) are not small and playful like the English ones. They are often tall and dark and usually malignant. The feminine of fairy is bean siḋe = banshee. She is a sinister spirit who follows certain Irish families. My father said she followed his mother’s family the O’Connells. She sits on a windowsill combing her hair at 3 a.m. whenever someone of the family is about to die. If the song meant what it says and what 9 out of 10 hearers will think it means (I don’t think it) how can the singer know in verse 7 all about the funeral arrangements if he died in verse 6 line 1. The widow is as economical as a lady should be. I take ‘they’ in verse 6 to be the French ‘on’ and not [illegible] the Singer and the No-Right Man. I think the singer is a brun and his wife a blondine. Hence the brown and the yellow. And perhaps the whole trouble comes from mixing one’s drinks. I think it is Mrs S. who speaks verse 4. And evidently the N.R. Man did not want her full pound of flesh or he had enough of her after 1 3/4 hours.",
