  "text": "Dear Stannie: I was very glad to hear the good news of your engagement for we have had only bad news lately, Aunt Josephine’s death, Nora’s uncle’s (Tom) and her sister (Annie). When are you to be married? At least I have a house now and it ought to be easier for you to pay us a visit. Can you come this autumn, for example? I will send you the fare and you could pass a pleasant time here. I have to undergo another eye operation this month, but I will time it according to your answer. Let me have a line by return, if you can. Tuohy’s portrait of Pappie is touring U.S.A. I asked him to try to do a sketch of mother from photographs. He managed to get two faded ones. Has Eileen any? If so it would be advisable to send copies of any or all at once to him (Prof. P.J. Tuohy, Metropolitan School of Art, Kildare Street, Dublin), as he is thinking of going to Spain. Thanks for Linati’s article. I never hear from him but a Milanese firm wrote asking for Italian rights of Ulysses. I never give them till A Portrait is first translated. The Spanish and German translations of it appear in November. The English printer of The Calendar refuses to set up a piece of my new book. It comes out therefore complete (the piece) on Wednesday in a Paris review. Do you intend to settle down in Trieste? And are you going to take an empty flat? This above costs me 20,000 francs a year empty with charges up to 25,000. I spent about 120,000 francs on it up to now so may the devil beautify it. The day after I got back here from Arcachon I got a slight attack in my eyes which are still dimmed with scopolamine so I cannot write very much yet. But I am writing so that you could make plans before the Berlitz-Biarritz season begins. Surely to God it is not necessary for you to give barking lessons to fioi-de-cani from dawn till gutterdammerung! I saw Schmitz once or twice here and introduced him to a lot of people. Did George Antheil call on you? He has set Cyclops episode. Give my regards to anyone who cares for them and first drop me a line in reply. Give our greetings also to our future sister-in-law and aunt (respectively) who is younger than her nephew. Jim",
