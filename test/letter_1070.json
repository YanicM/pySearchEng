  "text": "Dear Colm and Mrs Colm: â€¦ As regards your kind Dublin offer I cannot make up my mind to cross the second channel. My sight is too weak. I have not enough funds even if I draw these advances. I have not a friend in Dublin on whom I could rely. Please thank your sister. Perhaps if you were here we might talk it over. And too much publicity was given that Kensington ceremony. It was very thrilling when the registrar refused to function saying we should go and get divorced but after production of lawbooks by my solicitor he did the deed. While I was signing the roll the King was signing the new law the English call the Marry-Your-Aunt Bill. He should now sign a Marry-Your-Wife Bill Sincerely yours James Joyce",
