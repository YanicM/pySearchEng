  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: … The 3rd French Ulysse comes out on the 15.xi. Sullivan has gone away for 4 or 5 months and I began to write the 2nd part on Sunday last—but with what labour! It is always like that when I start a fresh bout. I have exchanged my old machine for a Remington portable and hope to learn how to use it myself. I sent the letters off to the Abbey Theatre. We had another letter from Dr Tibbies. If his Vi-Cocoa still exists I would like to have a packet of it. There is one last copy of Music and Letters I would like sent to my brother Stanislaus, whose address is 6 via Cesare Battisti, Trieste. I hope you are well. How long are you staying in London? My lumbago is quite gone but I can’t sleep at night. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. I should like you to enquire only if copies of Apes of God are to be had and at what price.",
