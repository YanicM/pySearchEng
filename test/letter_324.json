We think that it is a book which might or might not give a certain amount of offence to readers and while its merits are undoubtedly very high we should not, as a firm, care to issue it in book form.— Allow me however to thank you for your kind intervention with the firm on behalf of my poor stories. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
