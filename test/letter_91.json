  "text": "Dear Stannie I send you tomorrow the fifth story of ‘Dubliners’ that is, ‘The Boarding-House’. You are to dispose of it if you, can to an English or American paper. I have a copy by me. I have also written the sixth story ‘Counterparts’ and shall send it to you on Saturday if I have made a copy by then. It is my intention to complete ‘Dubliners’ by the end of the year and to follow it by a book ‘Provincials’. I am uncommonly well pleased with these stories. There is a neat phrase of five words in The Boarding-House: find it. John Lane has refused my verses and I have offered them to Elkin Mathews. You will recieve a volley of correspondence from me within the next week or so of which this letter is the first. I expect you have received by now the postcard I sent you on Saturday last, asking you to come here to Trieste as I wanted to speak to you on a serious matter. I have thought since that it might be too difficult for you to manage that and so I am going to discuss affairs by letter. You are to consider all that I write as intended solely for yourself and Aunt Josephine, and I shall be anxiously waiting for your replies. You will remember the circumstances in which I left Ireland nine months ago. Like everything else that I have done in my life it was an experiment. I can hardly say with truth that it was an experiment which has failed seeing that in those nine months I have begotten a child, written 500 pages of my novel, written 3 of my stories, learned German and Danish fairly well, besides discharging the intolerable (to me) duties of my position and swindling two tailors. I believe, besides, that I write much better now than when I was in Dublin and the incident in Chap. XXIII (?) where Stephen makes ‘love’ to Emma Clery I consider a remarkable piece of writing. Add to this that I have eaten and drunk enough to live upon, secured glasses and a watch, and am having my teeth attended to at last. I do not think that I have wasted my time but even if I had done so it would not affect what I am about to explain. I must, first of all, tell you that Trieste is the rudest place I have ever been in. It is hardly possible to exaggerate the incivility of the people. The girls and women are so rude to Nora that she is afraid to go out in the street. Nora can speak about thirty words of Triestine dialect (I tried and failed to teach her French) and so whenever she goes out I must accompany her and I have often to spend an afternoon looking for a very simple thing at a reasonable price. I must tell you also that as soon as she began to be any way noticeable we were turned out of our lodgings. This happened three times until I conceived the daring plan of living in the house next the school and astonishing the landlady by the glamour of that wonderful establishment. This ruse has succeeded so far but we are still in imminent danger of being put out. The director of the school and the sub-director (a vegetarian, and a German) have both wives but—no children. The director when he saw Nora said he thought I must be stark mad. The sub-director is also appalled. He has written in German and published at his own expense a ‘booklet of spring flowers’ in which there is a poem which begins ‘In drinking I did never lag’ ‘O, can there be for mother’s heart A fairer poem Than when her child after many an effort Lisps the first word.’ You will see from this what an interesting atmosphere I breathe but—to go on. Nora is almost always complaining. She can eat very few of the sloppy Italian dishes and whatever she eats gives her a pain in her chest. She drinks beer but the least thing is enough to make her sick. In Pola during the winter she suffered dreadfully from the cold and now (the thermometer being at 100° F or so) she lies nearly all day on the bed powerless with fatigue. The Trieste people are great ‘stylists’ in dress, often starving themselves in order to be able to flaunt good dresses on the pier and she with her distorted body (Eheu! peccatum?) and her short four crown skirt and hair done over the ears is always nudged at and sniggered at. I was thinking lately of renting a quarter (that is, two or three rooms and a kitchen) but a house-agent told me that it was very difficult to get into a quarter in Trieste if you have children. We have kitchen utensils here in the bedroom but we never use them as Nora does not like to cook in other people’s kitchens. So we dine out and lunch out with the result that I am continually borrowing money from the director and the other English ‘professor’ and paying it back the next day. Trieste is not very cheap and the difficulties of an English teacher living with a woman on a salary fit for a navvy or a stoker and expected to keep up a ‘gentlemanly’ appearance and to ease his intellectual heart by occasional visits to a theatre or a bookshop are very great. Having heard the first part of the story you can understand that the regime of these schools is a reign of terror and that I should be in a much more terrorised position were it not that many of my pupils (noblemen and signori and editors and rich people) have praised me highly to the director who being a socialist is very sensible of my deservingness in consequence. As it is I cannot look for a position in another school or, indeed, for any position. He gave me to understand one day very pointedly that whenever he found a teacher trying to get a post elsewhere he packed him off. He locked up my BA certificate in his safe where he said he had the certificates of the other ‘professors’ (a lie, of course, since I am the only qualified teacher here so far as Austrian law goes—being a doctor) and informed me that whereas his copy of my contract was stamped my copy of his contract was unstamped. The slightest disapproval on the part of my genteel pupils would be sufficient to obtain for me dismissal and with my ‘immorality’ belled about the town I should find it next to impossible to get anything to do here. There is no hope of advancement and a continual fear of collapse. This is the economic position. The moral position is not very re-assuring. Reserving my own case for the present I must tell you some more things about Nora. I am afraid that she is not of a very robust constitution. In fact she is not in good health. But more than this I am afraid that she is one of those plants which cannot be safely transplanted. She is continually crying. I do not believe that she wants to have anything more to say to her people but I am quite sure (it is her own statement) that she cannot live this life with me much longer. She has nobody to talk to but me and, heroics left aside, this is not good for a woman. Sometimes when we are out together (with the other English ‘professor’) she does not speak a word during the whole evening. She seems to me to be in danger of falling into a melancholy mood which would certainly injure her health very much. I do not know what strange morose creature she will bring forth after all her tears and I am even beginning to reconsider the appositeness of the names I had chosen (‘George’ and ‘Lucy’). She is also sensitive and in Pola I had once to turn the English teacher, a thoughtless young chap named Eyers, out of the room (much as I dislike such an office) for making her cry. I asked her today would she like to rear a child for me and she said very convincingly that she would, but, in my present uncertain position I would not like to encumber her with a family. Her knowledge of even ordinary affairs is very small and she cries because she cannot make the clothes for the child even after Aunt Josephine has sent her the patterns and I have bought the stuff for her. I have no time or patience now for theories as to what the State should do in such cases but I am simply trying to do what I think is best. I think it is best for people to be happy and honestly I can see no prospect of her being happy if she continues to live this life here. You know, of course, what a high esteem I have for her and you know how quietly she gave our friends the lie on the night when she came with us to the North Wall. I think that her health and happiness would be much improved if she were to live a life more suited to her temperament and I don’t think it right that even I should complain if the untoward phenomenon of ‘love’ should cause disturbance, even in so egoistically regulated a life as mine. The child is an unforgettable part of the problem. I suppose you know that Nora is incapable of any of the deceits which pass for current morality and the fact she is unhappy here is explained when you consider that she is really very helpless and unable to cope with any kind of difficulties. I do not know exactly the attitude of your mind towards her or towards the child which will be hers and mine but I think that in most essential things you share my opinions. As a matter of fact I know very little about women and you, probably, know less and I think you ought to submit this part of the case to Aunt Josephine who knows more than either of us. One of the English teachers said that she was not worthy of me and I am sure this would be many people’s verdict but it requires such a hell of a lot of self-stultification to enter into the mood which produces such a verdict that I am afraid I am not equal to the task. After all, it is only Skeffington, and fellows like him, who think that woman is man’s equal. Cosgrave, too, said I would never make anything of her, but it seems to me that in many points in which Cosgrave and I are deficient she does not require any making at all. I have certainly submitted myself more to her than I have ever done to anybody and I do not believe I would have begun this letter but that she encouraged me. Her effect on me has so far been to destroy (or rather to weaken) a great part of my natural cheerfulness and irresponsibility but I don’t think this effect would be lasting in other circumstances. With one entire side of my nature she has no sympathy and will never have any and yet once, when we were both passing through an evening of horrible melancholy, she quoted (or rather misquoted) a poem of mine which begins ‘O, sweetheart, hear you your lover’s tale’. That made me think for the first time in nine months that I was a genuine poet. Sometimes she is very happy and cheerful and I, who grow less and less romantic, do not desire any such ending for our love-affair as a douche in the Serpentine. At the same time I want to avoid as far as is humanly possible any such apparition in our lives as that abominable spectre which Aunt Josephine calls ‘mutual tolerance’. In fact, now that I am well on in my letter I feel full of hope again and, it seems to me, that if we can both allow for each other’s temperaments, we may live happily. But this present absurd life is no longer possible for either of us. my writing does not excuse him, in my opinion, for having behaved towards me treacherously. I often think to myself that, in spite of the seeming acuteness of my writing, I may fail in life through being too ingenuous, and certainly I made a mistake in thinking that, with an Irish friendship aiding me, I could carry through my general indictment or survey of the island successfully. The very degrading and unsatisfactory nature of my exile angers me and I do not see why I should continue to drag it out with a view to returning ‘some day’ with money in my pocket and convincing the men of letters that, after all, I was a person of talent. After a great dealing [sic] of hunting and searching I have thought of [a] plan which might be adopted as a temporary solution of the question and I am now going to set it out to you. It is now the month of July and next month the interesting event is to take place. From now to next Easter I could save perhaps twenty pounds, at least twelve. I can offer my thirty-three poems and my nine stories broadcast. My verses may be accepted by a publisher and when Dubliners is complete I intend to offer it to Heinemann, who, I am sure, will take it. Independently of this I could send home to you a certain fraction of my salary every month and by next Easter I am sure that I could have twenty pounds in Ireland besides the prospect of my verses and stories and novel selling. It would be possible for you to save, at least, the same sum in the same time and with the two we might take a small cottage outside Dublin in the suburbs, furnish it and pay the rent for a half-year in advance. I simply suggest this as an experiment which need not continue longer than twelve months if it were found to be unsuccessful. This suggestion, however, I am very reluctant to make for many reasons. First of all, it involves a serious infringement of your liberty but on the other [hand] I do not see that you would suffer very much economically since everything could be yours. You cannot tell when you may be forced to ‘compromise’ your liberty as I have been forced and certainly if you did entertain the idea of leaving Ireland and living in a Berlitz School on the continent you may entertain this idea. If you had a job of thirty shillings a week and we had put our saved sums together I think we could give my proposal a year’s trial. The second reason why I am reluctant to make this proposal is that I am uncertain whether you would like it or not. Not that I imagine that the atmosphere of our suppositious [sic] cottage could by any vagaries on the part of the two arrivals from Trieste become more unpleasant to you than the atmosphere you are at present breathing, but I am quite in the dark as to the attitude of your mind towards me and ‘my companion’. By the way, is there no method you can suggest of annihilating Hairy Jaysus? Isn’t he an insufferable object! The third reason why I am reluctant to propose this is that I have proposed so many things which are now considered follies of mine and done so few of them that I am beginning to think it is not right for me to expect people to help me out in my notions since I have become a settled person. However, in spite of my reluctance, I have made the proposal and there’s an end of it. I shall expect your reply and if you think well of it I can send you my first instalment at the beginning of August. I hope your letter will not delay in coming. Kindly believe that if there is anything abnormally unpleasant to you in this confession and letter it arises from my foolishness which is now to be reckoned one of my permanent assets. It is possible that my idea is really a terrible one but my mind’s eye is so distracted after nine months of my present life that I am unable to see things with my former precision. Of one thing, however, I am made aware from the obscure depths of my consciousness and that is, whether my present life end this way or another way, it will end shortly: and that will be a great relief to everybody concerned.
