  "text": "Had an interview this morning with Roberts lasting nearly 2 hours. I explained and defended the whole book from the 1st story to the last. He listened and noted what I said. I went to Lidwell’s office 5 times to get the letter he promised. Finally I got it. I did not take it round to Roberts (you will see why) and intend to think on the subject all night. I introduced Charlie to manager of David Allen’s Adv. Co. (with whom I left £50 of Volta money). He took his address and said he might be able to put him on a job during Horse Show or after and seemed inclined to employ him as he said it is not easy to get decent fellows for his jobs. Rochford (of the ‘quay’) offered me the post of tenor in Sandymount Church and invited me to his house next Sunday. I am advising Charlie to take the job if he can get it as it would be an opening for his voice at concerts and (if he can get it) he would get paid. Place the matter of house at once in the hands of a solicitor. I don’t believe they can effect an entrance on the 24th. I thought the new tenant had retired from the contract. Picciola and the agent are a pair of low brutes. If I had suspected anything I would neither have come nor allowed Nora to come and would have given notice to the Gas Office. At any rate the first thing to be done is this. The table in my room and the desk in my room are to be carried carefully and horizontally into Mrs Borsieri’s flat who, I am sure, will keep them for a few days. If she cannot keep both the table may be left with her and the desk is to be left untouched by permission of the new tenant if he enters. Neither table nor desk are to be removed from the house or floor. All papers on desk and my MS book of Chamber Music and my crest are to be rolled in a sheet and let Anna carry them untouched to Mrs Francini till I arrive. For the rest let the two swindling squinting hell’s bitches propose whatever they please. These letters appeared in all papers today. Pappie wishes me to interview T.W. Russell. I think I have done my part. Pay great attention to my directions as to my table, desk, MSS, verse-book and crest. All the rest can go be damned. I intend to sue Picciola and the agent for 2000 crowns damages for loss of press engagements, trouble, installation of gas etc and tell them so from me. The agent is the more to blame of the two. He is a lying thief and always looked it. Jim Roberts I saw again. He asked me very narrowly was there sodomy also in The Sisters and what was ‘simony’ and if the priest was suspended only for the breaking of the chalice. He asked me also was there more in The Dead than appeared. I enclose Lidwell’s letter (copy). I shall think what to do now Jim",
