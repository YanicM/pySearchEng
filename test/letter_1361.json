  "text": "Dear Budgen: Many thanks. Just what I wanted. Have used a lot of it. The encounter between my father and a tramp (the basis of my book) actually took place at that part of the park. I went to the Br Consulate and with the official consulted Lloyds Reg. for 1935. No trace of that phantom ship. Could you trace her? I hope you noted, by the way, the tayloren’s christian name. But one or two questions—I mean till you send back the book marked, which do, but registered to Paul Léon, 27 rue Casimir-Perier, Paris, VII. What is Devereux’s Christian name, also Sturk’s? Her name Lilia or Lilian? Is Archer (Dangerfield) an Irishman? In what chapter is Sturk’s dream of recognition? This point is a fine one, I think, since he saw the deed in a half dream. Why does Archer go back to Chapelizod and put his head in the noose? Yes, I know that sickening thud. But keep on, Bruce, saith the spider. What is the book called? I should subscribe to the Verdant One..",
