  "text": "Dear Sir: My delay in replying to your letter has been caused by my removal to this address. I thank you very much for kindly sending me a copy of your cantata. I have shown it as well as your settings of my verses to my singing-master who admires them very much. They are, however, rather low for my voice and also for this reason I am afraid they would not suit Mr J.F. MacCormack, who, I am sure, as a friend of mine would gladly have given them a trial. My father knows (or knew) well Mr Plunket Greene and if you think well of it I shall have his attention drawn to them. They would suit his voice and style very well. I have never seen Billy Byrne printed: but I am sure my namesake, Dr P.W. Joyce, will be able to tell you where it has been printed. If not you could ask Mr Best of the Feis Ceoil. Should you not find it I shall write down for you the version I have (which, however, is probably incorrect as I have it only by ear) and send it on to you. I am very glad you are doing more of those songs and much flattered by your liking for them. Perhaps the extracts of press notices on the book which I enclose will interest you. I also send you a little article of mine in the hope that as you are a musician you can read Italian. It was written on a fellow-countryman of yours (and mine) on the occasion of the first performance here this month of Straussâ€™s opera with Bellincioni in the part. With best wishes for the success of your cantata.",
