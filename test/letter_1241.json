  "text": "Dear Helen: Just got your letter. First, I hope your father is by now well on the mend. Give him our best wishes. Also am glad to hear about David. As for Stevie he sounds all right at this distance. Does Mme Gautier sing bass herself and how many hundred years training are necessary before a singer can face an American public? Don’t be downhearted, my dear little children. Everyone has an uphill time at first. You said you were sending us a clipping: There is none in the envelope. If Giorgio is irritated by the article think of this. This morning I received a proposal from the London firm which is supposed to be bringing out Ulysses. They want me to compose 735 headlines for the 735 pages e.g. p. 1, ‘On the Top of the Tower’, p. 2, ‘A Morning Shave’ ‘Theological Talk’ ‘The Inner Man Satisfied’ ‘Arrival of the Milkmaid’. As Mrs Colm would ask: Can you beat it? Lucia is as I told you with a nurse in Villa Elite. But I am sending away the nurse on Sunday or Monday as my sister Eileen is coming from Dublin to try out a stay of a month or so with Lucia’s [sic] at Lucia’s constantly repeated request. Have just wired her her fare. Please ask all the jews in America to get up a subscription for me as I am planning to enter the poorhouse on S. Patrick’s Day next. So please cheer up, do. And send me a group photograph like the last lovely one we had taken. I think you were the nicest of all, Helen. Goodbye. I have now to run in my slippers all the way to Cherbourg to catch that boat. Caro Giorgio: Buona fortuna! Or su! Corajo! Avanti, Savoya! Salutami il piccolo. Remember! Remember!! Remember!!! The 2nd of February is COMING Mi spiego? Tante belle cose Babbo",
