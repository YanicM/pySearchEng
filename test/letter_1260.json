  "text": "Dear Lucia: I send you enclosed here 2 more pounds sterling. I hope you have received the volumes of Tolstoy. In my opinion How Much Land Does a Man Need is the greatest story that the literature of the world knows. I used to like also very much Masters and Servants in spite of a little propaganda in it. I hope you are going more easily now with the eggs although they are the classic food for Easter. I had a letter from Helen. It seems that they all have their troubles. It is not their fault certainly but they have not found that lucky country that was their dream. Two little stories may amuse you. Giorgio has grown a beard and your letter to Giorgio made a pilgrimage first in the much-sung-of land of Germany. Yes, I read in the papers about the fire in the Square in Dublin. The news did not upset me much. But it seems to me that the lady Anna Livia did not do her duty even if the firemen did theirs. Much smoke and little water. But they will find another edifice in which to continue their noble work for the benefit of the Dublin hospitals and the poor doctors, the poor sisters, the poor sick people and the poor priests, consolers of these latter. Let me weep. And cheers for the race­horse! And talking of priests, if you subscribe to the library there ask for The Life of Father Healy. I knew him and I think that he baptised me or one of my family. He was the parish priest of Little Bray, used to frequent the viceroy’s court and was a very witty man. The angel who regulates the seasons has forgotten that we are on the eve of the month of May for he serves out to us every day cold, damp and cloudy weather. You speak of two ruffians who visited your bungalow. They were perhaps robbers who attempted some time ago to penetrate into the bungalow to steal the art treasures, cases with gold coins and precious stuffs which doubtless it contained. There are still idealists, apparently, in this cynical and rude world; the tram strike etc enters upon its ninth week. How fortunate for shoemakers. Not all ills hurt. From shoemakers to leather is only a step. This is why I inform you that Mrs Bailly has also gone to Bray or to the neighbourhood of Bray. I read that the municipal council is building many new houses. By Jove, it is understandable! We are fairly well and hope that your health is improving. Do not give way to moments of melancholy. Some day or other everything will change for you. And sooner than you might believe. Then according to you Curran has disappeared. Perhaps he is simply hidden behind a bush. And you have had tea with Miss Costello. Very good. That name seems Italian but is not so at all. It is a corruption, I think, of two Irish words meaning beautiful foot. Let us know if you need anything, that is to say, clothes etc for the coming season. The poet Byron wrote two apposite verses: The English winter ending in July To recommence in August. We always look forward to your letters and think a great deal about you, always hoping that your stay over there is doing you good. My greetings to your cousin Boschenka Boschenka Schaurek, daughter of Mrs Eileen Joyce Schaurek. who has written to me a couple of times and to whom I send thanks.",
