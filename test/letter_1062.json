Will you please let me know by return of post whether you received a letter from Mr Herbert Gorman asking you questions in connection with the biography of me he is writing. It is important for me to know this at once. My sight is a little better. I can write, as you see, and walk with prudence but alas! cannot read. Kind greetings from Nora Lucia and myself Jim",
