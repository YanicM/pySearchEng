  "text": "Dear Stannie, Card received. I cannot go back on my word here as it has gone the round of the bank. You will get this on Friday morning. Remember that I cannot go beyond Thursday so if you have not sent anything to reach me by then you must wire it. It is out of the question for me to get it. Try Effore or Santas or Guy. It is only a ‘matter’ of a few days. I can do nothing. ‘Buck up!’ My mouth is full of decayed teeth and my soul of decayed ambitions. Jim",
