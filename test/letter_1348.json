Perhaps she may be visited by my wife tomorrow, Rang up the villa today. No answer. I think the other girl is gone. So I can’t find the dog’s address. Looked all over the armoire but can’t imagine which of all the vets is yours? Let me know and will keep you posted. Unless Bertie your cook can tell us…. Glad you have got a house. Have a rest, tout le monde. … Babbo",
