  "text": "Dear Stannie The substance of the present is financial. It is Thursday morning the 16th and I have 25 lire. In my list I forgot to include bonnet for Georgie 3 lire but the real reason the money goes so quickly is that we eat enormously. Nora is getting much healthier looking. Here is her usual dinner—two slices of roastbeef, 2 polpetti, a tomato stuffed with rice, part of a salad and a half-litre of wine. We buy the meat cooked and then take it to a little wine-shop where we are supplied with plates &c. I think the only thing to be done is this: to ask A. for a week’s salary in advance and to send it to me. Remember that on Monday morning I shall have no money so that if you have not sent on some already you must telegraph it. The fifty lire you lend me this month I shall send you back on the 1st Oct with 50 of my own to put in the bank. I am reading The Picture of Dorian Grey [sic] in Italian. U.I. arrived with notice of G’s posad (marriage). What am I to do about G.R.? Yesterday we went to the cemetery. Pay no more bills: and please attend to this letter at once or I shall find myself once again in the sitting posture. Jim.",
