  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: Excuse this scribble. I am still ill—not eyes but grip [sic]. In fact have been ill since I left Z’ch. Transition, of course, is not yet out. I send you a copy of Verve. There are several mistakes in my text—misprints. But I am so tired I can’t correct them. It’s a pity you didn’t quote the sentences about Sihl and Limmat in your article on me? They are in Anna Livia Plurabelle. Also I got Zur, thanks and if you could send me 2 others, 1 for Giorgio 1 for Lucia. She has to be radiographed in the morning as it is thought she may have some local infection in teeth, none in any fool glands. All I can say about the future in Z’ch is I hope whoever has it will respect Villa Giedion, Othmar Schoeck, Vogt’s clinic and the Kronenhalle. But he can hang all the staff of the Elite Hotel in comfortable sacks out of their own windows for all I care and meanwhile Heaven help the poor jews who fall into the hands of Mr Prager’s cashier. Yes, I would like 4 or 5 of the photos in which my back is turned. This is my favorite portrait of myself. Thanks, dear Mrs Giedion. At last a view of myself which I can look at with some pleasure. I hope Giedion is getting on well with his Little New Yorker. I have no idea whether my son intends to return now as planned on the 20 April. They seem to be very nervous. No wonder. I hope your daughter is getting on well. She has youth on her side and will live down whatever she has wrong with her. Friendly greetings from us both sincerely yours James Joyce",
