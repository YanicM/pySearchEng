  "text": "Dear Mr Goyert: I hope you can read my writing. I can write my own writing but cannot read anybody else’s! Have just arrived here from Nice. After 12 years in Paris we are without a flat and all my books are packed up so I cannot lend you my copy of T.T. of S. and S. Perhaps Borach or Bródy could. But surely you cannot have finished A.L.P. yet? I am sending you a notice about Lucia (my daughter) which may amuse you. She has great talent. Is there any chance of your coming to Paris. We spent part of the summer in Feldkirch, a nice old town. I liked the people very much—old-fashioned and polite. I am trying to work. I must go back to Zurich every 3 months to be examined by Vogt. Did you see Jung’s article and his letter to me. He seems to have read Ulysses from first to last without one smile. The only thing to do in such a case is to change one’s drink! Our regards to all your family sincerely yours James Joyce",
