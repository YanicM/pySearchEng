  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I saw Dr Borsch yesterday after having waited two and a half hours. He says that probably both iritis and persistence of that nebula are due to root abscesses of teeth which should be drained or removed. He does not think in any case that I will have such an attack again as the eye reached a crisis which he says I got over. He wants to correct the right lens of my glasses and will then let me go to Nice on Monday or Tuesday. He says that if the stay there and the dental operation (which in his opinion will not provoke an eye attack) do not dissipate the nebula sufficiently a slight operation—not iridectomy or iridotomy but sphincterotomy will probably restore a great part of former vision. I am sending back a copy of press notices. I met Mr Jaloux who said he sent you a few phrases. I have indicated the places where he and John Eglinton enter the chorus. The lines cancelled can be used by them. I think this change ought to be made at once as both reviews are important…. I hope Dr Borsch is right. The prospect is not cheerful but I will let them (dentist and oculist) have their way in the hope that I may get back my sight. His opinion coincides with that of Dr James in the main for whom as for Dr Henry see Ulysses p. 243, l. 8. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
