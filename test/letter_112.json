  "text": "Dear Stannie I send you today [no word written] crowns which is the cleverest thing I can do. I have already sent you full instructions. I think you would not save much coming by Hamburg. The sea-voyage is 30 hours and the train would be nearly two days. You might eat the difference of fare. Perhaps a route such as London–Boulogne (or Calais)–Basil–Milan would be better. You are to leave Dublin at once and telegraph here when you leave. The message Left and address will make only five words. You are expected here by next Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest. Be sure to get well dressed even if you have to come a tedious route. Any money Kettle gives you you can use for this purpose. I have copied out the tenth story Araby but it would be useless to send it to you. I am now beginning the last story of the book Grace. I sent Chamber Music today to Constable & Co to whom A.S. had spoken of me. They are also to consider Dubliners, but I have offered it first to Grant Richards. If it is possible send a telegram from the nearest principal station so that I may meet you at the train. French money will do for you in France and Switzerland. Be sure you change money properly. You can change the French money in Italy if you want money: and when you get here you can change the Italian money. You can study here for whatever examination you are preparing for, and learn German or Italian in the school free if these subjects are on the course. Kindly let there be no mistake now. Jim. DO NOT GIVE A STORY TO KETTLE The Director cannot get the money from the Bank today. But he will telegraph it. You will receive it perhaps before you receive this letter. I have left a blank because I do not know how many crowns I can get.",
