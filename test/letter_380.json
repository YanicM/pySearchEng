  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver Many thanks indeed for all the copies of The Egoist. I am glad that you have changed your printer. The January number (printed by Messrs Partridge and Cooper) was very carelessly read (if read at all) by their reader. From several paragraphs whole sentences have been left out. My MSS are in Trieste but I remember the text and am sending the correct version of these passages to my agent. The instalments printed by Ballantyne, Hanson and Co (February to July) are of course carefully done. I hope the other printers did not set up the numbers which I have not seen (1 and 15 August, 1 and 15 September and 15 December). When you are sending me the August number perhaps you could send me also these numbers. With apologies for all the trouble I am giving you and kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
