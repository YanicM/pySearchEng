When I send it off I will write. I wonder if I can get away even then. I am glad you like the new Z. But I am utterly ‘moidered’ (Irish for confused in the head) by Anna Livia. I have spent at least another 150 at her toilet. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. The eyes are all right. J.J.",
