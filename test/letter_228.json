  "text": "Dear Stannie I received your M.O. for £3.5.0 and tonight I had a wire from Central Office London saying that your telegraphic M.O. arrived too late for delivery tonight but that it would be delivered on Monday morning £4.0.0. This covers my fare (£6) and leaves a few shillings. Unfortunately I must dodge Italy on the way back as I could not pass Georgie again without a half ticket. I return by Boulogne–Bâle–Zurich–Innsbruck–Laibach, as on Austrian and Swiss railways the age limit is four. I wire you tonight to wire £2.0.0, and if you do Eva, G– and I will start Tuesday night or Wednesday morning as the rest of her fare (but not more) can be managed, I think, and also her wardrobe. When you have done this get a camp bed for her as I wrote you I will bring bedclothes. If she does not start now she will never go. I shall remain until you wire me. Once we are settled back in Trieste things will fall into shape and money will begin to come in rapidly. Eva will hardly be an extra expense as I should have had to get a servant in any case and that would have cost me about 20 crowns a month, with which she can dress herself and take some lessons in typewriting and shorthand. She has learnt some dressmaking and says (or rather snorts) that she will be able to do something in that line. Georgie has grown so big that I could not possibly pass him as under three. He is as big as a child of six. I enclose two press cuttings which may interest you. Fallon is going into parliament, it is said. I hope you will have sent Eva the £2 by the time you get this. If not, get it and do so. Tell my creditors I shall be in Trieste in a week and will settle my bills then. The enclosed is for Nora. Jim",
