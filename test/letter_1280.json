  "text": "Dear Giorgio: For some time now we have not had any news from you but I hope this silence of yours is due merely to the present season, this stinking, pestilential, paralysing, plebeian, oppressive, dust-laden summer. Much good may it do us. I enclose a letter from Mamma’s uncle which explains itself but doesn’t explain the preceding facts. Here they are. Last Tuesday Lucia decided that it was time to change company and to replace Eileen and her daughters by Kathleen. She took the train at Bray, arrived at Dublin, went to the Central Post Office and sent off the enclosed telegram. She paid, turned to go out and ran into Kathleen who, unknown to her, had come from Galway that very morning. I am expecting another letter from Mr Healy either this evening or tomorrow morning. If it arrives in time perhaps I shall enclose it as well. Anyway I am sending you La Semaine à Paris, Irish Free Press, Revue Universelle and Transition. I hope this last one won’t aggravate your present state of summer stupor. The footnotes (3), (4) and (5) on the last page but one are all mixed up. But I don’t suppose you will get there before Christmas. And even the writer of this letter was so heedless the last time he wrote to you that he put ‘ogni talvolta’ instead of ‘ogni qualvolta’. How strange the memory is! To remember that after such a long time. I am also sending you a photograph of Mamma. I wonder whether Stevie will recognise her. O yes, I sent off the London Mercury too. In short, I send, I send AND I send. [Continuation in English] Dear G/. and H/.: Nothing strange or wonderful has happened since I last had this pleasure. In addition to the usual group we see Sullivan occasionally. Gorman seems to be in bad health. Huebsch called on me yesterday. He talked of inviting us to Sweden. I believe there was the greatest confusion at Longchamp on Sunday, all the sportifs and sportives had copies of La Semaine, opening it every two minutes. The mannequins ceased to parade and gathered into excited groups. O, qu’il est chic! Gentil, gentil! Une beautè! O, qu’il est mignon! were heard twittering from their bottlegreen lips. Most touching of all. The crack Irish jockey Steve Donaghue was showing it to the judge when his mount turned and rubbed his nose affectionately up and down the page. The President of the Republic then blew a whistle for silence and told the crowd to go home quietly with their copies as the Grand Prix stakes would be given to me without any race at all. Everybody said: C’est tout-à-fait parfait! C’est le meilleur chameau que nous avons en ce moment. Il le mèrite. Qu’il est bon, notre prèsident! Quel temps superbe! Une journèe vraiment remarquable! C’est magnifique! Bravo, Jigi! Nom d’un cheval, que nous sommes contents! Un chameau de tout premier ordre! … A rather funny thing happened the other night or rather evening. I came back earlier than usual from Léon’s as the girl was going away and I had to pay something we owed. As I was entering the lift a voice said: Bon soir Monsieur Joyce, comment, or perhaps it was only Monsieur, comment allez-vous? In the dim hall I descried a female form under a large white straw hat. As I hesitated her voice said: Vous ne me reconnaissez pas? Thinking it might be the Hon Mrs Fellowes I took off my straw and began the usual: Je demande pardon, Madame. Ma vue est bien basse malheureusement. There was a scream of laughter (No, I added: Avec qui ai-je l’honneur?) laughter from the old lamelegged concierge and … Antoinette who had to escort the bonne to the gare. Getting into the lift I said: Mon prochain livre s’appellera: Mes Gaffes. To which the lamelegged concierge replied: Monsieur, si ça est la pire gaffe que vous avez faite ce n’est pas grand’chose. Thereupon, I mounted hydraulically without saying a word to anybody on any subject whatsoever.",
