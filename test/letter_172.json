  "text": "Dear Stannie, Since Saturday last we have slept in the hotel but I think this is our last night there. After immense difficulty I have succeeded in getting a room and, if all goes well, we move in there tomorrow evening. This pleasant interlude has cost me about L25.—I spent all Sunday going up and down staircases and Nora and Georgie went about during the day, as witness a letter enclosed which an usher of the bank brought me in yesterday evening. Happily it was enclosed in an envelope. Item: a case for Mr Thomas Hardy. Tomorrow night I will go over my MS and send it to John Long. There is a publisher in London, name of Sisley, Ltd. He publishes ‘daring’ work. I saw a review in the heel of a D.M. column of a book by E. Temple Thurston, called ‘The Realist’. It was very daring and unpleasant, D.M. said, but showed unmistakeable talent. I have ordered it from England: it is a book of short stories. Do you think I did right? I was going to read Hardy through but I have changed over to Octave Mirbeau instead. I have ordered a Danish Berlitz book from Berlin. It will be published in January. In six months I ought to be able to read the Danish writers. I would like to read some of those at whom Ibsen hints in The Master Builder. One is named Nansen, I think. I wish I could go to Denmark. Ferrero says that Abo, Stockholm and Copenhagen are the finest cities in Europe. G.M. has rewritten The Lake. D.M. praises his artistic conscience. ‘Very few writers &c.’ The Maunsel Press has emitted some booklets, also: poems of Ella Young: and a young gentleman whom you may remember standing white-faced outside McGarvey’s has published verses in praise of, I think, the Sacred Heart. Wed. morn. I am sitting in the office. The winter has begun. There are no stoves, fires or pipes. My hands are cold. I blow my nose every three minutes. I have just read an advt in the paper wanted a manager for some place, salary L100 a month. What a beautiful country! Your friend H.J. ought to get a running kick in the arse for writing his tea-slop about it. I am damnably sick of Italy, Italian and Italians, outrageously, illogically sick. Every time a pupil asks me how I like Rome I vent some sneering remark. I hate to think that Italians ever did anything in the way of art. But I suppose they did. What did they do but illustrate a page or so of the New Testament! They themselves think they have a monopoly in the line. I am dead tired of their bello and bellezza. A clerk here is named (he is round, bald, fat, voiceless) Bartoluzzi. You pronounce by inflating both cheeks and prolonging the u. Every time I pass him I repeat his name to myself and translate ‘Good day, little bits of Barto’. Another is named Simonetti: They are all little bits of something or other, I think. This is my first experience of clerks: but do they all talk for 5 minutes about the position &c of a penwiper? I think the Irish are the most civilised people in Europe, be Jesus Christ I do: anyway they are the least burocratic [sic]. From the foregoing drivel you can judge the state of my mind in this country where ‘they drink nice wine not horrid black porter.’ Useless: too cold: stick hands in pocket. Thurs. morn. We are in our new quarters. Expected a letter from vou this morning here (bank). (Address at end of letter) Today after lunch I shall go over my MS for John Long. Frid morn No letter from you yet. Our room is quite small: one bed: we sleep ‘lying opposed in opposite directions, the head of one towards the tail of the other’. Blasphemed often while correcting MS. Stories dreadfully dull. When I get home at 10 o’clock after the bank and school and have taken my dinner I am so tired that I can barely skim over the Avanti or a page of a novel before my eyelids are heavy with the sleep men have named etc. To make up I get up about 7 o’c and go out and read in a café. I am reading Sebastien Roch by Mirbeau. The beginning deals with life in a Jesuit college. It must be difficult to succeed in France where nearly everyone writes well. I should like to read Zola but have not the heart to attack his twenty volume history of France. Who called Moore the English Zola? I wonder: he must have had large powers of comparison. I think I will read Mirbeau and Hardy together alternately. What are you doing in this line at present? It is a very dark cloudy day, drizzling rain. I wish some power would lift me as far as, say, Talbot Street and let me walk about for an hour or so and then lift me back again. My imagination is so weak that I am afraid all the things I was going to write about have become uncapturable images. It is 9.30. I would like to go asleep at present. My glasses annoy me. They are crooked and there is a flaw in both of the glasses. It is a bloody nuisance to have to carry bits of glass in your eye. A moment ago I was leaning my head upon my hand and writing when the banker rushed past me. He said something to me which I did not catch. I jumped up and went to his desk obediently: I had not heard what he said. He repeated it, however, smiling, it was ‘Diritto, Signor Joyce. Non è bello così.’ They are a funny lot, these bankers. There are four in all, two brothers Schumacher and father and son Nast-Kolb, also a younger one. One of them is like Ben Jonson with a big belly, walks sideways, wears a cap on his head, blinks his eyes. The brother is a little man white-haired with a pen behind his ear. These are the Schumacher brothers. One of them is (the elder) is [sic] consul for Austria-Hungary. The other family consists of father, who is very old, and bandy legged, with thick white eyebrows. Every morning he patters in here, stops, looks about him, says good-morning, and patters out again. The son, the brisk person, is like Curran in manner and complexion. Yesterday they put down carpets here: everyone said they were beautiful (How I hate that word). I suppose it would be the height of impudence if I said I think they are somewhat ‘common’ people. Anyway they talked a lot about the carpet. Letter just received. What I have told you about rooms is painfully correct. I don’t know why we were given notice by the landlady nor do I know whether it was the reason you suggest. I don’t know anything except that I suppose I ought to cease grumbling and take up the white man’s burden. Do you imagine you are corresponding with the indifferential calculus that you object to my vituperation on Italy and Rome. What the hell else would I do? If you had to traipse about a city, accompanied by a plaintive woman with infant (also plaintive), run up stairs, ring a bell, ‘Chi c’è?’ ‘Camera’ ‘Chi c’è?’ ‘Camera!’ No go: room too small or too dear: won’t have children, single man only, no kitchen. ‘Arrivederla!’ Down again. Rush off: give a lesson for 9½d, rush back to bank, etc etc. Am sending MS to John Long by same post. Didn’t change anything. No pen, no ink, no table, no room, no time, no quiet, no inclination. Never mind, it will be back in a week or so. Only I stuck in ‘bloody’ before the late lamented. How I should enjoy a night on Venetian waters with Miss Farchi’s romance and reality. The Italian imagination is like a cinematograph, observe the style of my letter. Wurruk is more dissipating than dissipation. Thanks for Whitman’s poems. What long flowing lines he writes. Kick in the arse for the following. G.K.C: G.B.S: S.L: H.J: G.R. Kicks in the arse all round, in fact. Write at once. Sent paper Sunday. Not surprised: Italian Post. Write.
