  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver … Here is a letter from Dr Codet and you will receive from Borach a letter the nurse sent by hand through Jolas written to her by Lucia, though unsigned and unfinished. It is a disquieting document. Will you please return it to me c/o Borach. My wife has not seen it. She insisted on going to F though Lucia wrote up a perfectly normal letter to me this morning saying she wanted to see me too and that I should not be left alone and that she and the nurse would come to Z’ch. She has worked on at her alphabet and has now reached ‘O’. Jolas says that 3 or 4 of the letters are astounding. What I find disquieting in the letter is not so much its exaltation. Each phrase could bear a rational meaning and some of the phrases are very fine. It is the lack of even casual connections. She has however gained 3 kilos, about ½ stone in 3 weeks. Also when she heard vaguely of what Vogt said she had a violent fit of crying and said she should come to Z’ch to stay with her mother. Anything, even weeps, which takes them out of absorption in themselves is a good sign. She could not gain in weight unless her mind were fairly free. My wife has gone to see if any plans can be made ahead. She does not think Lucia wants to leave us definitely yet and thinks we should prepare a Paris home. I will tell you more when she comes back. What kind of wandering willies are going flat-hunting these days? I mean your tenant too. My cook stays on by the month as his ‘chef’, the ambassador, is expecting to be moved. Do you mind sending Codet’s letter to Giorgio, La Ferme de May, Saint Jean-Cap Ferrat, Alpes Maritimes, France? He telephoned today from Geneva, near where his stepson is at camp. They are all well. I hope you have no more storms like the Monday one. A cloud burst here yesterday and gave me a great fright and a drenching. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
