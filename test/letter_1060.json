  "text": "Dear Pound I had another talk with Mr Pollinger of Messrs Curtis Brown’s yesterday. He seems to me to be a sincere wellwisher of yours and I hope you will send him the Ms and leave it in his hands for a few months, allowing him to shape the scheme I suggested to him as he thinks best. He believes it will be a help in view of the length of your book and the state of the market and would ensure extensive advertising by a trustworthy firm. I wrote a long express letter to Mrs Dyer asking her to send invitations to Miss Rudge and you for her evening and telling her about your Villon opera but my daughter-in-law does not say that you were there. MRS Dyer’s telephone number is; Trocadero 12, 04. YOU Mentioned Manon. There is a very good tenor Gerard singing this at the Trianon Lyrique. He sings the Ah fuyez, douce image with great effect. PERHAPS YOU COULD GO WITH Gorman, hetero-daktylographically yours James Joyce",
