  "text": "Dear Mr Palmer I am back here again as you see. Mr Best (ex-secretary of the Feis Ceoil) told me yesterday that his successor, Mr Charles Wilson, had written to you about your settings of my verses with a view to having them brought out. Have you done anything in the matter? I have spoken about you to the manager of Messrs Maunsel, Publishers, of here and he gave me to understand that something might be done in conjunction with a musical firm. Messrs Maunsel brought out a book of four songs by C. Milligan Fox. I heard one of them but your music is much finer. Is not the proprietor of Messrs Maunsel & Co, Mr Maunsel Hone of Killiney, some connection of yours? I heard he was. Perhaps you could interest him in the music. Yours very truly James Joyce",
