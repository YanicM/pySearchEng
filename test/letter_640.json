  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I enclose a press cutting which perhaps you have seen and a subleader from the Tribune (New York). This latter I copied out in an American bank here, having bribed the porter to let me look up the files of all the papers they had. The next day I copied out another from the Sun and the Boston Transcript but both so rapidly and illegibly in pencil that it would be useless to send them on. The trial took place on February 21, it seems. Since that time no person in New York has sent me a word of information on the subject. In fact I should know nothing whatever about it but for the fact that I was given one day in a bookshop here a cutting which the owner had received by chance from New York. I have written once or twice for information but in vain. As regards Ulysses itself Mr Quinn about four months or more than three months ago drew up a scheme for a limited edition. I agreed to his terms and he said he would have the contract signed…. It seems as if this year (1 + 9 + 2 + 1 = 13) is to be one incessant trouble to me. Four copies of Circe and Eumeus have been delivered to me at last. Unfortunately there are only 122 pp of the former as the present typist has got some position and can work only an hour or so at night. They (the copies) are so irritating that I wish I knew where to throw them. It is risky to send them to Mr Pound at a possible address and he does not appear to be interested in receiving the embarrassing parcel and Mr Rodker or the Little Review or Mr Quinn or Mr Huebsch may not want them either. The Circe episode, typed by several different people using different machines and all colours and kinds of paper is a horrible thing to look at—much less to read. By dint of writing several letters and telegrams to Trieste I received safely about a fortnight ago the bag full of notes for Ulysses. I regard this as one of the triumphs of my life. Ithaca and Penelope are progressing as well as the worries here set forth permit. The printing of the book could be started at once as it will take several months with the double proofs I need. I expect a cable on Tuesday or Wednesday. As soon as it arrives I shall let you know.",
