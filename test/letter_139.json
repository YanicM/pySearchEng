  "text": "Dear Stannie, I sent you today Sinn Fein with two marked paragraphs. I asked you to date your letters in order to see how many hours they took to come. I received a copy of the Independent some days ago but did not observe the notice I see marked in the copy you forward. I suppose it is by the merest chance I learn this. Who knows what else has taken place in Dublin? I was coming home to lunch from the bank when I met Nora in the street, holding out a paper and saying ‘Guess the latest, guess who’s married!’ I could think of nobody but the recently vested Charlie who, I perceive, is making great use of the suit and collars I sent him. When she showed me the paper first I thought it was a practical joke, as I imagined Gogarty either in New York or on his way to Italy and have been reading the columns of the Tribuna as I promised in search of his advertisement. However I suppose it is true. I see that it must be a sign of progress and of experience to feel one’s illusions fall from one, one by one. This particular loss, seemingly more of yours than of mine, is hardly suitable for discussion in letters. I disagree with you, however, when you say it would not have happened had I remained in Dublin. My feelings are double: first, I am puzzled to know whether he was in New York at all or not and why he wrote to me: and, secondly, I am curious to know how he looked in a tall silk. I fancy when he emerged from the church door his agile eye went right and left a little anxiously in search of a certain lean myopic face in the crowd but he will rapidly grow out of that remaining sensibility. However to be charitable I suppose we had better wish Mr and Mrs Ignatius Gallaher health and long life. You have often shown opposition to my socialistic tendencies. But can you not see plainly from facts like these that a deferrment of the emancipation of the proletariat, a reaction to clericalism or aristocracy or bourgeoisism would mean a revulsion to tyrannies of all kinds. Gogarty would jump into the Liffey to save a man’s life but he seems to have little hesitation in condemning generations to servitude. Perhaps it is a case which the piping poets should solemnise. For my part I believe that to establish the church in full power again in Europe would mean a renewal of the Inquisition—though, of course, the Jesuits tell us that the Dominicans never broke men on the wheel or tortured them on the rack. Do you think I should write to G.R.? I am thinking of rewriting A Painful Case so you might send me the MS along with the book of notes I had in Paris and the Latin quotations from the prophecies of the Abbot Joachim of Flora. This is a cursed pen but it is Sunday and every place is shut. Have you been to Can.? Pay no more debts without first telling me. By the way do you think you could send me any money. Whatever you send I can send you back at the end of the month and we could make the same arrangement for next month as I shall not be properly fixed until 18th Oct. Even if they send me away then I shall have 315 lire in my pocket or if they keep me 250. To account for my straitened state:",
