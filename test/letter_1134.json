  "text": "Dear Mr Bergan: I hope this finds you in good health and that you excuse me for not having written to you before but my daughter has been rather ill and I myself am here on account of my wretched eyes. I may have to submit to two more operations, making the full dozen, or the right eye may be left to go blind—the devil or the deep sea. It was very kind of you to act as you did about poor Pappie’s will and if you will let me know the cost of the tombstone I shall send a cheque for it. The names of my parents are John Stanislaus and Mary Jane. I wonder what became of all the signed editions of my books I sent to Pappie. Apart from any material value (the first Paris edition of Ulysses signed is worth about £35) I do not want them to be in the hands of strangers. You are in this book by name with so many others of Pappie’s friends. I remember very well your singing One of the Family and Sister Susie’s Playing. You always made the same mistake in one line of the latter, a mistake prompted by politeness and encouraged by conviviality, for you sang ‘would make both you and I sick’ instead of ‘would make both me and you sick’. My grandson Stephen was born a month after Pappie died. I wrote a little verse about it and if I ever publish it I will send you a copy. No man could be worthy of such intense love as my father had for me With many remembrances and all good wishes sincerely yours James Joyce",
