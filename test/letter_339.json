  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards, In reply to yours of 20 inst: The book is in the form approved of by me, i.e. with one or two slight changes already made. I am willing to omit the preface from the book and to have it replaced by the introduction you speak of. There is not the least fear of an action. If you have read between the lines you will see that the constant objections raised in Dublin were excuses and nothing more. Some person paid the Dublin printer for his work. I did not. As to modifications of the present text all things considered had we not better waive this point. I am willing also to take for sale here 120 copies at trade price. I think of publishing two of the stories in an American magazine and the Italian version of one (Ivy Day) in the Nuova Antologia, where the book is promised an article of notice. If so would you wish it to be known that the publication by you in book form is to be expected. I daresay you know your business better than I: but I fancy the ‘curious history’ of Dubliners is a notable affect. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
