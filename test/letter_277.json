  "text": "Dear Stannie I know nothing of any 40 crowns. Zannoniâ€™s man was here six times in three days. He had orders to take the piano yesterday but I prevailed on him to wait another day. As I have already paid 300 crowns I think it would be silly to lose it. Kindly send me today at least one month for him and I will pay the other and in addition some money for the house which you arranged to give if I paid the bills. If not I must sell part of my furniture. I do not understand your obscure threats! but I paid the money. I got away relying on your promise to keep the house going. Jim",
