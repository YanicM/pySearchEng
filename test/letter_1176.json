  "text": "Dear Budgen: I enclose £1 for the frame. Karsten’s part was Thersites in Troilus and Cressida which even Phelps did not give at his famous Sadler Wells season. A wonderful creation—a parallel part to Cyclops ‘I’. Proofs came, Léon away on holidays. Gilbert with a broken arm, I recovering from breakdown No 4 this year. Trotzdem, S.G. and I have gone through 20 of the galleys but you must arrange to stop here 24 or 36 hours on your way to Ascona. My wife asks me to say that we will be glad to put you up and that it is no bother at all. Apart from corrections I am making a short list of things you ought to put in notes. It reads very well. You will certainly make a great hit with it and get more orders for essays or pictures just as you like. You ought to arrange a show. By the way, hang on to your MS. Please bring with you or send me Lefanu’s book. I want to see something in it. My own copy is in the garde-meuble. I cannot see anything on p. 47 about the tenor voice. By the way, would anyone lend you a dress suit and shirt? S. is not singing this week but I should like you to hear him sing Eleazar (the old Jew) in La Juive next week. I suppose it is impossible. Let me know by return about your arrival here. I see S.G. again today and we will get on. Don’t worry about bothering me. That’s all right.",
