  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Last night at 6 o’clock Mrs Harrison, to whom the final scenes of Circe had been passed on for typing after the accident to Dr Livisier, called on me in a state of great agitation and told me that her husband, employed in the British Embassy here, had found the MS, read it and then torn it up and burned it. I tried to get the facts from her but it was very difficult. She told me he had burned only part and that the rest was ‘hidden’. I begged her to come home and bring me the rest. She left, promising to return in an hour. I waited till 10.30 but she did not return nor did she write or telephone today till now (11.30 a.m.). I suspect she has concealed some of the facts. As I am very tired please excuse this brief note. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. I withdrew Ulysses by cable an hour after receipt of your letter.",
