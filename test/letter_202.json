I hope you may have sold off some more of that large remainder. When you returned me the MS of my other book Dubliners you mentioned a Mr Hone who desired to read it on behalf of Messrs Maunsel. I should be obliged to you if you could put me into communication with him as I wish to get the book off my hands. Faithfully yours James Joyce",
