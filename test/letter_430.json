  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for your kind inquiries. I have had no more attacks and feel better and am making a kind of cure. I sent four photographs (very bad, I believe) and yesterday a better one which Mr Kristian can perhaps use before it is sent on to Mr Huebsch. I shall send another copy within the week so as to be in time for the English edition. I hope you received safely my letter in reply to Mr Huebschâ€™s request for biographical material. I am infinitely obliged by all the trouble you have taken about my tiresome books and would beg you, as a very great favour, to telegraph to me as soon as you know definitely that the book has appeared in New York. With kindest regards and thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
