  "text": "Dear Aunt Josephine I have been a very long time answering your letters but I have been very busy. Yesterday I sent my book Dubliners to a publisher. It contains twelve stories, all of which you have read except the third story Araby and the last one Grace. I have also been deterred from writing by the knowledge that voluminous correspondence was taking place between Stannie and some person or persons unknown and I was waiting until I was [sure] I would find disengaged ears. Moreover I have very little news to send you. I imagine you must be tired hearing my explicit or implicit complaints about my present life and therefore I shall not trouble you with many in this letter. You are not to argue from this that I am in the least resigned. In fact I am simply waiting for a little financial change which will enable me to change my life. At the latest it will come at the end of two years but even if it does not come I shall do the best I can. I have hesitated before telling you that I imagine the present relations between Nora and myself are about to suffer some alteration. I do so now only because I have reflected that you [are] a person who is not likely to discuss the matter with others. It is possible that I am partly to blame if such a change as I think I foresee takes place but it will hardly take place through my fault alone. I daresay I am a difficult person for any woman to put up with but on the other hand I have no intention of changing. Nora does not seem to make much difference between me and the rest of the men she has known and I can hardly believe that she is justified in this. I am not a very domestic animal—after all, I suppose I am an artist—and sometimes when I think of the free and happy life which I have (or had) every talent to live I am in a fit of despair. At the same time I do not wish to rival the atrocities of the average husband and I shall wait till I see my way more clearly. I suppose you will shake your head now over my coldness of heart which is probably only an unjust name for a certain perspicacity of temper or mind. I am not sure that the thousands of households which are with difficulty held together by memories of dead sentiments have much right to reproach me with inhumanity. To tell the truth in spite of my apparent selfishness I am a little weary of making allowances for people. Perhaps you can send me a critique from a Dublin paper on Moore’s novel in which Father O. Gogarty appears. I hope you are in good health. Jim",
