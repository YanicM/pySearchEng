  "text": "Dear Nora Having left me five days without a word of news you scribble your signature with a number of others on a postcard. Not one word of the places in Dublin where I met you and which have so many memories for us both! Since you left I have been in a state of dull anger. I consider the whole affair wrong and unjust. I can neither sleep nor think. I have still the pain in my side. Last night I was afraid to lie down. I thought I would die in sleep. I wakened Georgie three times for fear of being alone. It is a monstrous thing to say that you seem to forget me in five days and to forget the beautiful days of our love. I leave Trieste tonight as I am afraid to stay here—afraid of myself. I shall arrive in Dublin on Monday. If you have forgotten I have not. I shall go alone to meet and walk with the image of her whom I remember. You can write or wire to me in Dublin to my sister’s address. What are Dublin and Galway compared with our memories? Jim",
