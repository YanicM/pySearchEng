About Irish songs, I suggest 1) Buy Hughes’s Irish County Songs (2 vols) (they are nearly all Ulster songs) at Steinway Hall, 111 W. 57th Street. 2) Buy Moore’s Irish Melodies and learn the following (this is a lovely air but G. should study the legend of Lir’s daughters) 2) [sic] I shall try to get from London and send at once",
