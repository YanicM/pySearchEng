  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: You must have had a bad time on the Manche but O think of what you are away from here. Friede has not replied. He told Antheil that I had concluded a pact with him and disposed of the book. Miss Beach, as I suspected, seems to have believed this and still half believes it. Conner over the telephone today told me that it seems to him a second Roth affair and that for the moment I was completely in Friede’s power and to proceed very carefully. This is what I tried to do. Hill, transition’s lawyer, wrote saying: You will see by the enclosed copy of Mr F.’s letter to me that he has ceded the copyright to Mr Joyce. There was no enclosed copy. He was cabled to but has not replied. I wanted the current issue of t. and the first ½ of Yabcd which I had set up to reach my lawyers before any other person could copyright them and have them set up there at my expense but Mr Jolas has been ringing up to say the printer had a special holiday etc and so t. 11 has gone to America. Miss Beach and Mr Jolas had a fine old set-to on the heels of which I arrived. There was an awful lot of snappy thunder in the air but I managed to keep to my point. Jolas has just written a very good article and while I want an explanation I don’t want a quarrel which may be unnecessary. Miss Monnier is still grippée (so is Miss Moschos now) but when she gets better there will be a general brisking up of the artillery. Moreover my trunk’s by no means the trunk he used to was and as for my poor brainbox why it’s falling down all the time and being picked up by different people who just peep inside as they replace it and murmur ‘So we thought’! Lucia dances through it all. She was very good, I think. I am very glad you came to Paris for at least I know where I stand. Of which more anon. I met the greatest editor in the world in the office of the consulate of the greatest empire on earth. He signed the power of attorney, saved me 25 francs, took me home in a taxi and offered me an aperitif—unaccepted. The greatest surprise in history. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
