  "text": "Dear Larbaud: I must thank you for the allusion to me in that interview. But how am I ever to live up to it? I had a letter from ‘Italo Svevo’ this morning. He is in despair about his book. If you manage a short note on it somewhere or, as you suggested, give some pages of it in the second number of Commerce you would do much more for him than my mention of Les Lauriers sont coupés did for Dujardin. I am very glad you liked the prayer. Pleasant holidays! sincerely yours James Joyce",
