  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: My health is very poor lately. I have been laid up again with my eyes and so am obliged to dictate this to you. I had been expecting an express letter from you but now five copies of my play have come. I suppose one has gone astray. Will you please tell my American publisher to correct at once the following mistakes, English edition and paging: p. 17 for ‘are not mine’ read ‘are not nice’ p. 116 for ‘O please call’ read ‘O please don’t call’ p. 118 for ‘hear you voice it’ read ‘hear your voice say it’ The printing seems to be very careless. No revise was sent me in seven months. Was any advance of royalties paid either on the English or the American edition and have you got any further A/s from New York? If my publisher there wants to do so he can publish the first three episodes of Ulysses in autumn as a paperbound book and episodes 4 to 13 also when I have sent them and finally episodes 14, 15, 16. Have you sent a copy of Exiles to the ‘Pioneer Players’ and to Miss Horniman? Please thank my American publisher for his promptness and for the interest he takes in my writings and ask him to send me a copy of his edition of the play and the American notices both of it and of my book of stories as I have not seen these. I should also be very much [obliged?] if he would send against my account a copy of Mr Lawrence’s novel The Rainbow. I hope that my eyes will soon allow me to set to work again, if only for a time, on Ulysses. I believe Miss Weaver cannot find anyone to print it.",
