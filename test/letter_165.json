We regret that we cannot publish Dubliners even with the emendations you suggest: as it stands it would bring you neither money nor reputation. If you could finish your novel and it has the strength of your stories it would bring you both m and r: and then, as I said, Dubliners could follow it. The MS of your verses goes back to you under separate cover’ Am writing to hold him to 1st letter, as I told you. Send at once ‘instructions’ for the verses. Will it be in your power to send me anything by the middle of the week? You said you could during the last week. Instructions at once. Jim",
