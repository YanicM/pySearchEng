  "text": "Dear Miss Beach: Many thanks for the drops. The Mistral at Avignon was so strong I was afraid for my eyes but they are all right. It is very fine down here and the Lord keep it so. I did not get a letter from Paul yet but got a kilo of proofs and a letter from Sage. I don’t feel a bit inclined to start on them yet. I read in the D.M.that Mr Gabriel Wells, publisher of New York bought some old book at an auction for £5000 and Mr Crosbie Gage of NY a MS notebook of Kipling, for $5000! Why couldn’t either buy that 1st edition of Dubliners? Have you any good book in English about Provence? And have you FMF’s Good Soldier? I am going to give you some trouble. 1st. Can you buy a cheque on London or Dublin for £5 for my sister Eileen Schaurek, and send it to her, 19 Whitworth Road, Dublin? 2nd. Can you send 250 francs in my name to the Corinth fund, to Mr Photopolous (I think that’s his name) treasurer, Greek Legation, Paris? That will be about 860 altogether which please deduct from my credit. It is the least I might do, I think. If I had more I would send more. I also solved L.C.’s problem about the creatures. On thinking it over I suspect the Jabberwock is really a transformation of the Cheshire Cat which was all grin: Cf. ‘the claws that scratch’ etc and ‘Longtime the Manxmost foe he sought’. Now the leastmanx cat is short of a tail so I suppose a manxmost cat has neither head nor tail. (Like your letter: Pensée de la Lectrice.)",
