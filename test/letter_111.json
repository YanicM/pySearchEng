  "text": "Dear Stannie I enquired today about the Hamburg route. Hamburg–Trieste, third class (via Leipsic–Dresden–Vienna) is 77 crowns. The train journey is 36 hours. The sea voyage London–Hamburg is nearly 20 hours so I am not much inclined to advise you to come that way; I am not sure even if it is the cheapest route. Try what it costs via Ostend. The sea trip is only a few hours. The railway would be Ostend–Brussels (or Luxembourg)–Monaco–Villach–Trieste. In any case tell the clerk you want to travel over German railways as they are much cheaper. Nora wants you to bring her some Indian tea in one of your pockets. The only tea here is Russian. You will be just in time for the new wine and roast chestnuts and you will be able to decide perhaps as to what language your eldest nephew Georgie speaks. I shall expect your telegram on Thursday and I hope also to have an answer to my postcard. After a month perhaps we could rent a small quarter. You have 40 and I have 45 crowns a week: that is 85 crowns (£3–11–0) and we might get a piano also. The director has offered to give me some furniture. He is very friendly with me because one of my pupils—Count Sordina has praised me very highly and brought several real live ladies and gentlemen of his acquaintance to the school. I wrote yesterday to Constable promising to send them Chamber Music in a day or two and Dubliners in a week or so. I sent Symons a copy of The Holy Office which I hope he will distribute among his friends. I am copying out the eleventh story Araby, but I hardly think it will be worth while sending it to you as, I hope, you will be here so soon. I need hardly say how glad I will be to see you. I advise you to show these letters to Pappie as he may be able to help you. As for leaving the children in the lurch—what can you do in Dublin? You say you have been looking for a job (9 hours a day) at 15s/– a week. This job is 33s/– for 6 hours a day. Besides if my books are published I may be able to help you and Charlie to something definite. But what use is it to talk of the future. I have many other points connected with it to discuss with you. This day twelvemonths I was in Paris after touching Dr Rivière successfully. We drove from the Gare S. Lazare to the Gare de l’Est in an open carriage. I will be in Paris again I am sure and in Dublin too. I am sure you will be glad to see Georgie. He is damnably fat and long and healthy—I suppose because Nora nurses him herself. He has a pair of big dark blue eyes which he doesn’t get from me. Thanks be to the Lord Jaysus no gospeller has put his dirty face within the bawl of an ass of him yet. Jim. Bring the tea in a loose package for fear of the Custom-House officials.",
