  "text": "I dare not address you tonight by any familiar name. All day, since I read your letter this morning, I have felt like a mongrel dog that has received a lash across the eyes. I have been awake now for two whole days and I wandered about the streets like some filthy cur whose mistress had cut him with her whip and hunted him from her door. You write like a queen. As long as I live I shall always remember the quiet dignity of that letter, its sadness and scorn, and the utter humiliation it caused me. I have lost your esteem. I have worn down your love. Leave me then. Take away your children from me to save them from the curse of my presence. Let me sink back again into the mire I came from. Forget me and my empty words. Go back to your own life and let me go alone to my ruin. It is wrong for you to live with a vile beast like me or to allow your children to be touched by my hands. Act bravely as you have always done. If you decide to leave me in disgust I will bear it like a man, knowing that I deserve it a thousand times over, and will allow you two thirds of my income. I begin to see it now. I have killed your love. I have filled you with disgust and scorn for me. Leave me now to the things and companions I was so fond of. I will not complain. I have no right to complain or to raise my eyes to you any more. I have utterly degraded myself in your sight. Leave me. It is a degradation and a shame for you to live with a low wretch like me. Act bravely and leave me. You have given me the finest things in this world but you were only casting pearls before swine. If you leave me I shall live for ever with your memory, holier than God to me. I shall pray to your name. Nora, remember something good of the poor wretch who dishonoured you with his love. Think that your lips have kissed him and your hair has fallen over him and that your arms have held him to you. I will not sign my name because it is the name you called me when you loved me and honoured me and gave me your young tender soul to wound and betray.",
