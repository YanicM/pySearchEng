  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Thanks for your letter. I could not answer till now as I have been very ill. I quite agree to Miss Weaver’s proposal. Have you received any royalties from New York publisher for sales of my novel to date? And have you any news from Miss Horniman on the Pioneer Players? I shall be glad if you can send a note to the Reverend Stephen Browne, S.J., Clongowes Wood College, Sallins, Kildare, Ireland thanking him in my name for the inclusion of me in his work Ireland in Fiction and, as he invites corrections for the second edition now in the press, informing him that I was born in 1882 (2 February), that my father’s family came from Cork not from the west of Ireland. My father is from Cork city, his father from Fermoy, county Cork. The family comes, of course, from the west of Ireland (Joyce’s country) but mine is a southern offshoot of the tribe. My wife is from Galway city. My other works of fiction not mentioned in his book are A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (press notices enclosed for him) and Ulysses. I should prefer that this letter came from you but I feel I owe you an apology in advance for giving you so much trouble.",
