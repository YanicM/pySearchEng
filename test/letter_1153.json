  "text": "Dear Budgen: The British Customs have now decided to send back the whole English edition to Paris after 3 weeks muddle-headed correspondence. There is however one solitary copy at Bumpus’s in Oxford Street so you and Sargent could see it there. Tell me how you like it. She has done a whole alphabet since and I think the letters would stand well before the 23 stanzas of Chaucer’s alphabet-poem which begins ‘Almighty and almerciable queen’ (i.e. the Madonna) J.J.",
