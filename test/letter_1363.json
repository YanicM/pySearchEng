  "text": "Dear Budgen: Got back and have now seen Léon. He says author’s rights in the case of a posthumously published book are retained by the author’s heirs till 50 years after his death. If you have any doubts about this I shall write to Benjamin Crémieux, secretary of the P.E.N. Club. I have used almost all of the information you sent but am waiting to amplify it from the text marked by you so you may return it here registered when you like. As regards S S J.J. the connection is not so much with Shaun the Post as with my father John Joyce. The boat is not in Ll’s Register for ’35. It may be in ’36 or ’37. I had copies made of the advt and sent them to members of the family, among others to my cousin Gretta Yeats in London saying that if my father was employing his postvital hours transporting Dubliners round the bay she could be sure that her two uncles James and Freddy (mentioned in my books) would be among the most reminiscent occupants of the saloon bar. Her husband Cyril Yeats answered me saying that on the day I wrote my cousin she died. I had no idea she was even ill…. Kind greetings to you both and if you come to the ‘expo’ which is right in front of my halldoor please take it home with you before I visit it with edificidal thoughts.",
