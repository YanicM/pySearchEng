  "text": "Dear Budgen: What the hell kind of an address is this? And are you there? And are you coming back to Z.? I send you enclosed description of pictures which have been offered for sale, prices marked on back. The daubs are here in Z. If you can sell any of them you get 5% or 10%. I forget which. The whole lot would bring a commission of 30,000 frs., I think. Write and be damned to the waste of ink. Am taking P.S.’s verses now to the Zürcher Post. Am sending you a photo of myself. Portrait of my wife framed and up. 5000 frs cabled from U.S.A. for my cause. Everyone beginning to be on the move here. I have offered to finance the E.P. After prolonged deliberations they very kindly and most considerately consented to accept 10,000 francs of my dirty money in consideration of my former good behaviour and unstained character. Am arranging a concert of Irish traditional and modern music for the Tonhalle with Milner as singer. Arrivederci presto, pittore bevitore.",
