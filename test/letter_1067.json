  "text": "Dear Mr Bródy: Many thanks for your friendly joint card of good wishes for Bloomsday. I am answering it through you because I want to thank you also for your flowers last year on the same date. And also I wish to ask a favour of you. Will you please destroy the record I sent you of Sullivan in Guillaume Tell. I sent out about twenty of these without having heard them and now that I have heard them I find them atrocious. Such a record can do him only harm and I am trying to avoid that by asking my friends to destroy them. Please give my kind regards to Mrs Bródy Sincerely yours James Joyce",
