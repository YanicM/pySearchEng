  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: My husband is recovering slowly after the operation. It was difficult but we hope successful. He thinks that as the second edition is set up perhaps the owner of the printinghouse will consent to allow it to go out. If not perhaps Mr Edward Marsh, Colonial Office, Downing Street, can assist you in the matter of importing sheets from New York. If so, you could at once cable for sheets the expenses being to my husband’s charge. I shall see that the 1000 press notices are sent on to you. I am glad to have this opportunity of thanking you Dear Miss Weaver for your heroic efforts in my husband’s interest. Sincerely yours, Nora Joyce.",
