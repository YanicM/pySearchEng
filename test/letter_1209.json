  "text": "Dear Budgen: I meant to write you a much longer letter than this but am rushing it off for I have a fit of ague for the past 24 hours and my eyelids are thick and smeared with protective salve. Must leave this pretty but all-too-humid spa for drier Luxembourg. But write here. I’ll get it. I thought Matisse’s ideas would interest you. When sending back Leon’s letter tell me what you think. They are pretty much the same as yours? He is to ring me up from Paris today with a string of queries. O Lord, the one day I feel so shivery-shaky! What I really want to show are the 2 enclosed letters. I thought, about 2 years ago, I had arranged through Holroyd Reece, manager of the Albatross Press, and his friend a Mr Stanley Morrison of Burns & Oates for the latter to bring out Chaucer’s A.B.C. poems with a preface by Louis Gillet and Lucia’s lettrines. B & O were to do it on a commission I being prepared to agree to pay 225 £ and to pay for the preface and its translation. I did this and waited about 4 years. No move. Then the Dutch firm who have just brought out the 4th fragment of W i P (by the way, have you it or do you want it?) offered to bring out the book without any payment from me and pay royalties. I tried to get the lettrines back so as to deliver them in July and thus catch the Xmas market. Eight months’ correspondence. Useless. Now it seems the idiots have lost the lettrines. Do you know anything of Mr Morrison? Anyway if these letters are lost I think I ought to sue them? Urge on your publisher to bring out a cheap reprint of your book and as soon as possible. I am sure there will be a much bigger demand for it after the U.S. result. The government can still carry the case to the U.S. equivalent of the House of Lords. But I doubt it. A pity that when I win after 18 years struggle the $ drops 50%. Such is life. Now I am going to cover myself up like the babes in the wood sincerely yours James Joyce",
