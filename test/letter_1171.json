  "text": "Dear Mr Bródy: My best thanks, however belated, to Mrs Bródy and yourself for your kind remembrance of Bloomsbury Fair. I heard part of Mr Birrell’s lecture before leaving ‘Paname’ and I liked it. If I knew his address I should write to him to thank him for so kindly making me a gift of the typescript. I am sorry about the delay Frau A.L.P. finds in making her bow to the German public but agree with you that, as things and people are just now, the least said the soonest mended. With best wishes for the summer vacation Sincerely yours James Joyce",
