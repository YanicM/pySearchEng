  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Will you please send on to Miss Beach for her archives the papers I sent and also the German and Italian ones I shall send when you have read them. The former is very interesting. My verses have gone to the printer and last night I finished correcting proofs of my new book which will be published in a day or two. I mean instalment 3. The verses in …. Look at that! It must be Pound did it, I mean dun it. Seriously these pens are a terror. I can’t get one to work right. I filled it just before I began. The verses in a week or so. I hope the size of the libricciattoluccio will have the same stimulating effects on my colleagues as my libromaccione seems to be having and that we shall see plenty of 1 + 1 volumini about. I shall use some of your suggestions about X1U+25A of which you have a right idea. The title is very simple and as commonplace as can be. It is not Kitty O’Shea as some wit suggested, though it is in two words. I want to think over it more as I propose to make some experiments with it also…. My remarks about the engine were not meant as a hint at the title. I meant that I wanted to take up several other arts and crafts and teach everybody how to do everything properly so as to be in the fashion. I have offered the only copy (printed) of the Dublin edition of Dubliners, burned 1912, to Rosenbach and if he buys it I would like to go to the Dutch coast and rest; if that be possible. London gets worse and worse every year for storms in summer. Paris too with all this wireless. Among the latest to express dislike etc of my work is Sidney Schiff. I lay down my pen anyhow and if I knew anyone who I thought had the patience and the wish and the power to write Part II on the lines indicated I think I would leave the chair too and come back in a few years to indicate briefly how Part IV should be done. But who is the person? There is no such absurd person as could replace me except the incorrigible god of sleep and no waster quite so wasteful though there is one much more so. Peer Gynt says at least: Han er faderligt syndet imod min Person Men økonom!—nej, det er han ikke!",
