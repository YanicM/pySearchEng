  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I could not write till now (not even now) as I have been getting into ever deeper Liffey water. I want to leave the piece with Miss Beach for the September Calendar, I have taken immense pains with these three pieces, I hope they justify it. The richer they are the less hard will be the other parts of the book if … and when … I have still several days more to work on Anna Livia and then I need to go away for a rest…. I saw Dr Borsch. He is surprised I cannot see better, is positive I will see. I asked if another operation might be necessary. He said: I think not. The article by Mr Muir is not a reprint. I walk an hour in the morning and the same in the evening with determination. I wish I had finished this piece and was sitting in a railway carriage. I hope you are having a pleasant stay up there…. Do you want me to send on the typescript. I should prefer not for a reason which I shall explain later. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
