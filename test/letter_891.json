  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Yabcd was accepted by the Dial for 600 dollars and a week later they cabled, declining to print it as it stood whereupon I recalled it. (I enclose it in four pictures from the G.P.O. vestibule here.) I then set to work, in spite of moving about, to finish the U piece for Wyndham Lewis who wrote to me from Spain that he was coming to Paris to see me. I finished it and sent it to Paris to be typed and hope to correct it tomorrow and send it to you with the MS. I suppose no other review will take Yabcd but I will give it to anyone who will print it. Antwerp I renamed Gnantwerp for I was devoured there by mosquitoes. I liked Ghent and also Brussels. I would like to stay a week in the Ardennes before going back to Paris but I may not do so, as I am not sure when Mr Goyert may arrive in Paris to continue the German translation with me. I am sorry the Dial has rejected the pieces as I wanted them to appear slowly and regularly in a prominent place…. I finished my course of 64 Flemish lessons and will use bits of the language I have picked up for friend Sookerson, I think. Have you finished reading Patran and Tristpick and so on? A rather funny idea struck me that you might ‘order’ a piece and I would do it. The gentlemen of the brush and hammer seem to have worked that way. Dear Sir. I should like to have an oil painting of Mr Tristan carving raw pork for Cornish countrymen or anicebust of Herr Ham contemplating his cold shoulder. I see you have had more storms in England. I am always glad when summer is gonnen out for that reason. I don’t think I have had more than three letters during the past two months, except from Miss Beach who recently wrote to me that a Cambridge student told her some professor there lectured on Ulysses and expected every pupil of his to know it like a textbook….",
