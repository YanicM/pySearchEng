  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: It is some months since you heard from me but I sent you a few messages in that time. I finished the revision of the fragment for publication last night at seven, and, I suspect, my literary career at the same time. Before I start explaining the reasons for my persistent silence I had better put in the forefront the most irksome part of this missive, namely that I must ask you to instruct Messrs Monro Saw to sell out immediately two hundred pounds of War Stock and oblige me by remitting the amount, as they are usually kind enough to do on return of the witnessed forms. I shall explain later in the letter why I need this. A state of tension, of a somewhat more acute kind than those with which you have been occasionally acquainted in the past, has developed in the last few days between the Rue de Grenelle and the Rue de l’Odeon so that I do not think it politic for me to present myself there for a week or so, the tension being chiefly at that end, until this matter is settled. The causes of this are ostensibly the fact that I have overrun my royalty account by a month or so but in reality the reason is somewhat different, for at no time in the past ten years have I ever been exact in this respect. I will now jump into another part of the pool of despond. One of the reasons is said to be that I did not take the opportunity of accompanying Sullivan to Barcelona to see the oculist he has such faith in Dr Barracquer. I had several reasons for not doing so. When he mentioned him to me several months ago I wrote to Barcelona a long letter narrating the full history of my case, and adding that my daughter had a cast in her eye which she was rather diffident about having operated. He replied, quoting very high fees (which I had asked about), almost completely ignoring my case, and replying mainly to the part about Lucia. She has since been successfully operated. It was nothing at all, it took twenty minutes to do (Collinson did it), she came home in a taxi and in a week both her eyes were straight, and she suffered practically nothing. In the second place I disliked the idea of going to a country where the political dictatorship had just collapsed and I have been told that the dictator himself is now dead. If Sullivan had been singing in Barcelona for a few weeks, I might still have gone, but he was only passing through it on his way to Algiers and we should have been alone, I being almost helpless on account of my sight, had anything occurred. While I was turning these things over in my mind Mrs Sullivan rang me up, nominally about her daughter. I must tell you that his daughter aged 23 was some weeks before that in a very critical state. Neither the father nor the mother is a practical person and the doctor they had was a thorough fool.. he had diagnosed the case as one of appendicitis and was starving it accordingly. The mother-in-law who lives with them then got a stroke of hemiplegia and I prevailed on Sullivan to call in Dr Fontaine who at once brought the girl to a radiologist and it was found that she had tubercular peritonitis. If this discovery had been made ten days later the case would have been hopeless. As it is, she has had five weeks of ultraviolet rays treatment and is to be sent to Switzerland on the fifteenth of April for a six months cure in the mountains, which it is believed will be successful. As Sullivan was singing that night in Belgium I asked his wife to dine with us. She told me that he was inclined to be vague and unsatisfactory in such matters and that nobody had any influence over him except myself and that she wished me to urge on him strongly the necessity of making all the arrangements before he went to Algiers, as afterwards it might be too late. I said I would do so though I did not think it necessary. She then asked me whether we had decided to go, adding that he was not going alone. It struck me then that it was unwise for me to travel on this particular occasion, though she said that I was the only one of his friends to whom he had not introduced the lady and that he probably would not do so, but would rejoin her from Barcelona on. There is nothing very terrible in this, tenors I believe according to the modern Ulysses, have usually several cases of the same kind running concurrently. The surprising thing is that in this case there is only one and that it has been going on for twelve years. Still, not knowing precisely what the upshot of the journey might be it seemed better to stay in Paris and await his return to Paris, which I expect will take place on scheduled time in spite of the hinted hints. There was finally another reason. I had lately had some gossip carried to me about Sullivan and myself which I thought it better not to encourage, especially since from another quarter my wife’s name was involved in it too. I am sending you however under separate cover, along with my American lawyer’s letter—of which later—letters from two ladies concerning doctors in Wiesbaden and Zurich, and I think I will try one of these— for the moment which I don’t know. I heard from Miss Beach that you are very disturbed about the notices in the English press concerning my oncoming blindness, I wonder who is responsible for these. The sight of one eye becomes slowly worse, while the sight of the other becomes slightly better. What can possibly be the causes in my bodily condition or habits which militate for one and against the other? Dr Fontaine is also rather distant with me. I have the highest opinion of her and allowed her to bring me after Borsch’s death to be seen by a young French ophthalmologist, Dr Hartmann, who said the only possible solution of the case was that my eye trouble proceeded from congenital syphilis which being curable, he said the proper thing for me was to undergo a cure of I have forgotten what.. I told this to Dr Collinson and he dissuaded me strongly from undergoing it. He said that at the very beginning Dr Borsch and he had discussed this possibility and that Borsch had excluded it categorically on account of the nature of the attacks, the way in which they were cured and the general reactions of the eye. He said too at any moment a skilful operation on the left eye ought to give you normal sight, the eye ground being quite healthy, but he had known cases in which the use of the drug in question had had a bad effect on the optic nerve. So that ended that for me. If you knew how highly the disease I have mentioned is respected in this country you would understand Dr Fontaine’s aloofness. Syphilis is for the French what God Save the King is for the English, when it is mentioned tout le monde se decouvre. Now let me tell you what has been done in these last few months. The second German edition of Ulysses came out and the third is to come out in June. The second French edition came out and the publisher appears to be quite happy about it. Gilbert has finished the revision of his first proofs and his book is to come out the third week in April. A L P is announced to appear on May 1st. I offered H.C.E. to the Fountain Press, successors to Crosby Gaige. They declined to pay the price asked, whereupon I gave it to Babou and Kahane of Paris, who will bring it out on the 12th April. Hearing this, the Fountain Press partner in Paris came to me and asked me for a fourth fragment after having just turned down the third! I gave him an evasive answer whereupon he found out Messrs Babou and Kahane and bought up half the edition in advance. Messrs Babou and Kahane plus Mr Adams then wrote to me via Pinker, making me an offer for an advance on the completed book and I also received a similar offer through the Chicago Tribune from a house in America named Selt, proposing what they called a stiff sum in advance and expressing their willingness to wait seven years for the completed manuscript. I shall return to the offer transmitted by Pinker about forty pages later on, when I get back to the rue de l’Odeon. Other things done are .. the Polish and Czech translations have been arranged. Exiles was produced in Berlin at the Deutsches Volkstheater on the 9th, they invited me to be present but I did not go. It is to be produced in Milan on the 15 April. The English translation of Dujardin’s book will be published by the Mandrake Press with a preface by George Moore and a note about my connexion with the book. Two of Gilbert’s chapters have appeared in French, in Echanges and the Revue de Geneve, but it is scarcely worth while sending them since the English book will be in your hands in a few weeks. I think it probable that Fourcade my French publisher will do this in French. He gave a big dinner for me some days ago, one of the best I ever saw on a table. But I was anything but a success and when I tell you that I left before the champagne you will be able to judge in what kind of a mood I was. However I sent madame a bouquet next morning and I will ask them to dine with me in a more quiet way soon. Conner, my American lawyer in the suit against Roth, has sent me his bill for £600. I do not propose to pay this as it seems to me exorbitant for the ends gained. The Paris section of this bill of costs is £200 and the New York section £400. The publishers of HCE paid me on signing the contract fifty per cent of the whole amount, namely 25000 francs, out of which I paid 13000 francs arrears of income tax and 6500 rent and charges. I have still to pay 14000 francs arrears of income tax, but I can do this in two lots as I arranged through one of the managers of Lloyds Bank here who is a great reader of mine. I propose, however, to instruct Babou and Kahane to pay over the other £200 due on the first of May to Conner, as these people, in addition to bungling the case, for they could have pressed for the injunction right away, have been the manipulators of the difficult question of copyright in my present work, of which more anon. Aldington has sent me a message that I am not to pay anything, as it is or ought to be a public question, in view of the judgment obtained, but I had already had copies of the injunction sent to the directors of the Pen Club and I do not know whether they have moved even so far as to publish that injunction in their journal. Aldington has been very active lately about me and has been agitating to have the ban on Ulysses lifted; so that for the settlement of the balance I shall wait on till I hear more of his plans. When I ceased contributing to Transition I felt a sudden kind of drop as I was determined not to try to attack the second part in such an ill-equipped state (the revision of this last fragment has been a frightful job, extending over two months day and night sometimes till one in the morning, with seven different people helping me to do seven different parts of the labour, but of course such a condition of affairs could not possibly continue). In this frame of mind I first heard Sullivan singing and for the last four and a half months I have been working incessantly to try to get him past the Italian ring which protects the London, New York and Chicago opera houses. In temperament he is intractable, quarrelsome, disconnected, contemptuous, inclined to bullying, undiplomatic, but on the other hand good humoured, sociable, unaffected, amusing and well-informed. He supports a family connection of eleven people and is fifty years of age. In these circumstances it was necessary for me to force the pace and I did so. I got him very fine notices in the Morning Post (twice), Daily Telegraph, Daily News, Manchester Guardian, Irish Independent, Irish Statesman, Chicago Daily Tribune, New York World, New York Sun (twice), Daily Mail, New York Times with photograph, l’Intransigeant and la Rampe of Paris. I have made a side attack on the Chicago and New York Operas. As a result I have obtained for him his first engagement in Dublin; he is to sing there on April 27th, for which he gets £120, five times as much as he draws at the Paris opera. Also Sir T. Beecham whom I got to send over two critics to hear him has promised to engage him for the English production of William Tell, probably at the same figure, and Adams, who has a finger in theatrical pies also, has promised, chiefly with an eye on my book, to arrange a series of symphonic concerts for him in the United States. All this, for a person who really exerted himself and did not know very well the milieu in which he was working, involved a tremendous amount of telephoning, writing, interviewing, newspaper hunting, theatre-going, entertaining and being entertained. As a result of all that and the revision of H C E, I am quite flattened out and in fact for the last two days have been having quite a series of miniature fainting fits, lasting only a few seconds. Sullivan, thank goodness, has gone to Africa for a few weeks, but in any case I shall ease off when he comes back, for I have set in motion all the machines I could think of. I think there is more behind the state of tension I alluded to in the beginning than my well known inability to keep accounts straight. For a few weeks it was smilingly tolerated as a fad, but when it was seen that I went farther and stronger, the impression was made that I had gone slightly soft in the head. My introduction of Sullivan down there dispelled that impression, thanks to his breezy French manner and general air of having escaped from a boarding-school at the age of forty nine. But when I again resumed the campaign, the former impression came back. You must know that the opera in Paris is considered, not without some reason, by the Paris intellectuals as beneath contempt and the spectacle of the immensely illustrious author of Ulysses endeavouring to hustle crowds of journalists and protesting admirers into that old fashioned playhouse to hear antiquated music sung by old timer Sullivan was too much. No doubt I may have exaggerated in my exertions for him and perhaps made myself ridiculous in the eyes of sober thinking people, but I do not care very much, for it is incomparably the greatest human voice I have ever heard, beside which Chaliapine is braggadocio and McCormick insignificant. On one of the evenings he sang when Miss Beach and Miss Monnier were present I said, it may seem incautiously, when asked by the latter why I had done all I had for a person they considered unknown, that since I had come to Paris I had been introduced (i.e. by them) to a great number of recognised geniuses, without specifying names, in literature, music, painting and sculpture, and that for me all these persons were quite sympathetic and friendly, but that they were all, for me, perhapses, but that there was no perhaps about Sullivan’s voice. I said this purposely, first because I have always insisted that I know little about literature, less about music, nothing about painting and less than nothing about sculpture; but I do know something about singing, I think. And secondly because I am being continually placed in difficult situations which I am not quick-witted enough to know how to handle by the sudden exaltations and depressions of the Odéon Bourse, not, of course, where I am concerned, because they have never swerved in their loyalty to me. The second cause is this—I have spent a lot of money and diplomatic efforts in securing for myself a copyright of Work in Progress in the United States. I have it, but they have me too, just as I had it and they had it in the Roth case. To maintain my copyright there, I have no option. I must publish first through an American firm. Adams, who is a lawyer, knows this and Conner had told me so already. I dislike this. I have confidence in Miss Beach and I have none in Adams or in any other man publisher, for that matter, for all of them whom I have had up to the present were either incompetent or dishonest or both. But Miss Beach naturally feels that the book that she has been waiting for and has helped me so much with, is not being energetically enough given to her by me. This is not a case for energy but for prudence and some form of compromise, American wealth, law and power being what they are. The third point is my apparent indifference concerning the Ulysses editions, articles and publications, apart from their sales, and my inclination to cease where I am and let someone else write the rest. I cannot discuss this last point now, for these last days I am light in the head. I do not think that if I cease working there is much point in my continuing to live in Paris. It involves continual sacrifice of capital for one thing, which up till now was covered over by an output on my part, so that I do not think I shall renew the lease of this apartment, and as for my books it is useless to transport immense loads of what I cannot read so that I think I shall keep only the signed gift books and good old dictionaries. These questions I shall now think over, having nothing else to do, as I have to decide by May. I will now end this letter and I hope it has not bored you too much. I now refer your attention to the first paragraph and if the affair can be fixed up by Monday or Tuesday (it usually takes a week) I shall be much relieved. The general health here is good and I hope yours is, except for the lightness in my head. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
