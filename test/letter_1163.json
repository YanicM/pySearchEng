  "text": "Dear Magee: I owe you a letter but I have been wretchedly, though not gravely, ill. Moore’s executor wrote me a letter of apology but why pursue the matter? I did what I thought was right in view of his age and eminence. Yes, your article in “Life and Letters” was read to me (I can write but can read only with the greatest difficulty). I found it very friendly and the criticism very sound probably though most of the statements of fact are inaccurate. This, however, is of no importance. I send you a photograph and a leaflet which may amuse you. Apart from the O.U.P. book there is a very curious edition of Pomes Penyeach with capitals by my daughter on show at Bumpus, Oxford Street. If you are ever in London perhaps you will look at it. I suppose you are right about Ecce Puer. One English reviewer (probably a Scotch bard after office hours) described it as ‘some insignificant verses about Father Christmas’. Did I give you a little edition of Anna Livia Plurabelle, signed by me? I mean, when we met in the Euston Hotel? If I did so, will you give me in exchange a signed copy of Pebbles from a Brook? I was trying to have this translated into Italian when the European war broke out. I should greatly appreciate it.",
