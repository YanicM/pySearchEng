  "text": "Dear Larbaud: I suppose Miss Beach told you about my collapse. I cannot see a single word of print and of course am dreadfully nervous on account of it. They are giving me injections of arsenic and phosphorous but even after three weeks of it I have about as much strength as a kitten and my vision remains stationary that is in the dusk with the light behind it. They examined ‘all the internal organs of the beast’ and his blood pressure and found everything normal except his nerves. Apparently I have completely overworked myself and if I don’t get back sight to read it is all U-P up. I passed on all your corrections with my suggestions to Miss Monnier. Morel I have not seen this long time but I shall write to him if and when I feel a little stronger. He has misunderstood here and there but it would be unfair to lay too much stress upon that in a work of such length and difficulty. I am glad you liked my name for the little priest. I hope you will soon be in Paris so that we can have a chat. Did you get my telegram from Salzburg in time for your birthday—a very beautiful town and the most courteous people imaginable but the climate helped to play havoc with me. I sent you through Miss Beach a copy of Tidbits with Miss or Mrs Ursula Bloom’s advice on when to say yes, which must have amused you. Of course you have read all about Svevo’s tragic death. But I don’t think he would have lived very long even in the normal course of things as his heart was seriously affected. I am glad we were able to do something for him, a great deal in fact for the German edition must be out by now and an American publisher has cabled for the American rights. Nino Frank, a friend of Bontempelli’s of 900, has been commissioned by the Florentine review Solaria to collect opinions for a special number to which you, Crémieux, Goll, Goyert and I are asked to contribute. In view, however, of the ill-timed polemic in the Italian literary press after S’s death I think it impolitic that we should do so now at any rate, so I suggested to Crémieux and Frank to have this deferred for three or more months at least until the acrimony has spent itself and they have arrived at the firm conviction that la scoperta Francese is a pure myth after which we shall all be much more amiable and it would not greatly matter who writes or what he writes. Please let me know what you think of this. Anna Livia Plurabelle, which we read to each other under the sign of the great bear, rue Danau with our field marshall’s cocked hats of coloured paper resplendant on our intelligent heads has come out in a limited edition for subscribers but though I have no control over these I have cabled the only begetter to keep one of the reserve copies unnumbered for you if you would like to have it. My wife joins me in sending all good wishes to Mrs. Nebbia and yourself and let us hope that we shall both be rid of dieting etc. in the near future. With kindest regards, J.J.",
