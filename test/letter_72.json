  "text": "Dear Stannie Please send me the ‘Irish Homestead’ containing my story and the Xmas no. At the end of the week I send you Chaps XII. XIII. XIV. I am now at Chap XV. and have begun the Italian version of ‘Mildred Lawson’. I wish you to write at once about these chapters. You may lend them to Cosgrave or to Curran as you please but to no-one else. You may read them to Aunt Josephine. Say I write to her tomorrow. You are perhaps surprised to receive such bare letters from me but I find I have not much to report. The weather is bitterly cold and we have no stove. I write chiefly in the cafés. Fräulein Globocnik, the secretary of the school, has a piano and invites us for some evening⁠[s]. She is a melancholy little Androgyne and very sentimental with me. I daresay there is something in me which interests women. I desire more money and liberty than I have at present and for this reason I am working at the novel and at the translation. You notice a fall in my spirits. This is not quite well expressed by you. My new relation has made me a somewhat grave person and I have got out of the way of dissertations. I drink little or nothing, smoke vastly, sing rarely. I have become very excitable. Nora says I have a saint’s face. Myself I think I have the face of a debauchee. But I am no longer so—at least I think I am not. One night I had a severe cramp in my stomach and Nora prayed ‘O my God, take away Jim’s pain.’ The other evening we went to a bioscope. There were a series of pictures about betrayed Gretchen. In the third last [act] Lothario throws her into the river and rushes off, followed by rabble. Nora said ‘0, policeman, catch him’. We have had quarrels—funny affairs. Nora says they were lovers’ quarrels and says I am very childish. She says I have a beautiful character. She calls me simple-minded Jim. Complimenti, Signor! Our house is unhealthy and I am looking for new quarters. Nora has conceived, I think, and I wish her to live as healthily as possible. My child, if I have one, will of course not be baptised but will be registered in my name. I do not like talking of this subject yet. I am not much changed in appearance: a little stouter, new brown clothes, a slight moustache, and a loose scarlet tie. My voice has disimproved greatly for want of practice and from too much smoking as well as from chronic cold. I shall go to an oculist next month to get pincenez glasses which I can use on occasions as my sight is lamentable. I don’t think I have many spiritual moments to chronicle. I do not believe I shall write any more songs. You might look up every English review for the past year and see if there is an article on D’Annunzio’s ‘Figlia di Jorio’. If there is not I would prepare an article. I expect your reply to my ‘Speaker’ postcard this week. If you could get a key for my trunk in Duke St I wish you would as I never received the key you sent. I have also lost that old ‘Speaker’ which I should like to have. You must be contented with this letter and write fully, as I am now going home. It is very late and it is a cold walk. Jim Caffé Miramar.
