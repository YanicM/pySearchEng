  "text": "Dear Stannie Where is the MS of my novel? It is most thoughtless of Curran to give it to anyone without my permission. I did not send it to Dublin to have it circulated from hand to hand. I added Curran’s name to yours and Cosgrave’s because he treated me very kindly. I must pass a week of torture until I know whether it is safe or not. You must get it from Kettle at once and send it to me safely registered. Kettle, of course, is a decent kind of a fellow but some of these impostors might wheedle it from him. He is too polite to suspect treachery. Have you any idea what anguish I suffer from all this incertitude? Send me A Mother back. Symons who answers my letters by return of post (being an Englishman and a stranger) wishes me to send both my MSS to Constable to whom he has spoken. I shall call to see the director after lunch and answer your indefinite letter definitely. J.",
