My daughter has been very ill indeed these last six months and four days ago my son too had to undergo an extremely delicate operation. He is now getting on well. LÃ©on will undertake the work of course but he says it is not the same thing now as it would have been in January when the text, with insertions and alignments, was quite fresh in his mind. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
