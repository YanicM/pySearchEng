  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards, Many thanks for your letter of 9 ult and also for the bundle of press cuttings which I read with great interest. I am sorry that I do not find the signature of the critic of the New Statesman as I should like to send him a line of thanks. I did not find any notice from the Freemanâ€™s Journal (Dublin) or from Sinn Fein (Dublin). I shall send back the cuttings in a few days. I enclosed a list of misprints which you asked me to send you. It is a pity that a revise of the proofs was not sent me. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
