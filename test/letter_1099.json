  "text": "Extracr (sic) from The Groves of blarney (Air: The Bells of Shandon) by Richard Milliken And there’s a stone there that whoever kisses HE never misses To grow eloquent. ’Tis he may clamber to a lady’s chamber Or become a member Of sweet parliament. A clever spouter He’ll soon turn out or An out-and outer to be left alone. Don’t seek to hinder him Or to bewilder him Sure, he’s a pilgrim from the Blarney stone. (it is the second of the four masters, who here represents Munster, answering. He has been asked a riddle. What Irish capital city of six letters, beginning with D and endung with N etc etc’ but he answers) Dorhqk. and, sure, where can you have such good old chimes anywhere, and leave you, as on the Mash and how ’tis I would be engaging you with my plovery soft accents and descanting upover the scene beunder me of your loose vines in theirafall with them two loving loofs brace-letting the slims of your ankles and your mouth’s flower rose and sinking öfter the soapstone of silvry speech’ Dear Pound: There is nothing phallic about the Blarney stone, so far as I know. The founder of the castle was a cunctator (or perhaps it was the defender of it). He kept on inventing excuses, parleys etc during its siege, I think in the time of Essex. The stone is flat and so far as I can remember let into the wall a few feet below a window. I never understood why it could not have been kissed from a ladder. I heard there were double bands of elastic to fasten the women’s dresses. I did not kiss the stone myself. I hope you had a pleasant ceppo. Ours was saddened by the death of my father in Dublin He loved me deeply, more and more as he grew older, but in spite of my own deep feeling for him I never dared to trust myself into the power of my enemies It has been a great blow to me. We send you and Mrs Pound our best wishes for the New Year sincerely yours James Joyce",
