  "text": "Carissima It was only when I had left you some time that the connection between my question ‘Are your people wealthy?’ and your uneasiness afterwards struck me. My object, however, was to find out whether with me you would be deprived of comforts which you have been accustomed to at home. After thinking a good while I found a solution for your other question—this, that you were undecided whether I should be living in or out of the college. I slept very, very badly last night, waking four times. You ask me why I don’t love you, but surely you must believe I am very fond of you and if to desire to possess a person wholly, to admire and honour that person deeply, and to seek to secure that person’s happiness in every way is to ‘love’ then perhaps my affection for you is a kind of love. I will tell you this that your soul seems to me to be the most beautiful and simple soul in the world and it may be because I am so conscious of this when I look at you that my love or affection for you loses much of its violence. I intended to tell you that if you receive the least hint of any act on the part of your people you must leave the Hotel at once and send a telegram to me (at this address) to say where I can see you. Your people cannot of course prevent you from going if you wish but they can make things unpleasant for you. I have to meet my father today and shall probably stay in his house until I leave Ireland so if you write write there. The address is 7 S. Peter’s Terrace, Cabra, Dublin. Adieu then, dear Nora, till tomorrow evening. Jim",
