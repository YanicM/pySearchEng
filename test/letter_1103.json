  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Thanks for your message of sympathy. I spent the four days after Xmas sending messages to my father by wire and letter and by telephone to the hospital every evening. The weeks since then have been passed in prostration of mind. Gilbert came here four or five times but I could not collect my thoughts or do anything. I am thinking of abandoning work altogether and leaving the thing unfinished with blanks. Worries and jealousies and my own mistakes. Why go on writing about a place I did not dare to go to at such a moment, where not three persons know me or understand me (in the obituary notice the editor of the Independent raised objections to the allusion to me)? But after my experience with the blackmailers in England I had no wish to face the Irish thing. And all my family and even my Irish friends were against it. My father had an extraordinary affection for me. He was the silliest man I ever knew and yet, cruelly shrewd. He thought and talked of me up to his last breath. I was very fond of him always, being a sinner myself, and even liked his faults. Hundreds of pages and scores of characters in my books came from him. His dry (or rather wet) wit and his expression of face convulsed me often with laughter. He kept it in old age. When he got the copy I sent him of Tales Told etc (so they write me) he looked a long time at Brancusi’s Portrait of J.J. and finally remarked: Jim has changed more than I thought. I got from him his portraits, a waistcoat, a good tenor voice, and an extravagant licentious disposition (out of which, however, the greater part of any talent I may have springs) but, apart from these, something else I cannot define. But if an observer thought of my father and myself and my son too physically, though we are all very different, he could perhaps define it. It is a great consolation to me to have such a good son. His grandfather was very fond of him and kept his photograph beside mine on the mantelpiece. I knew he was old. But I thought he would live longer. It is not his death that crushed me so much but self-accusation. Helen is not delivered yet. Since Miss Beach screamed at me as I told you and said she would give the rights to me as a Xmas present (she did not) I heard no more till she returned my last letter to Conner without comment and the enclosed. An imbecile thing it is, too. She rang me up a day or so ago in a great excitement about my ‘jubilee’. People had come from Berlin where they were going to do something or other. She said she had intended to leave Paris for a holiday but if I liked she would cancel that and organise something here too. I was too dejected to make a reply. I am glad this letter did not cause the collapse the other I wrote caused. But it tired me a little. I hope your own news is good. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
