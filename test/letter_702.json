  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for the plan. Besides misprints I see with surprise that it is in part mislined making nonsense of the middle of the scheme. I shall have the omitted lines inserted, the whole retyped and send it back to you. I suppose you saw the article in the Daily Herald of last Friday. I could get only 2 copies here so that if you have a few I should like to have two or three. The artist’s impression of me struck me so forcibly that I thought the only thing to be done was to send you a recent photograph which I hope you received. Is it possible to find out diplomatically whether there is a copy of Ulysses in the British Museum Library? An order came from the Greek manuscripts department but it may have been private. Another order, it seems, from the library was transmitted by a bookseller. If they have no copy I shall present one, of course. But if they have one already it is useless to waste a copy. I suppose a notice or notices will appear this week. Mr S.P.B. Mais of Daily Express who got a copy says he will write an ‘appreciative article’. The question of press and library copies which has been worrying me has been solved at last but not until Miss Beach went down to Dijon. She came back yesterday and everything seems to be in order now. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
