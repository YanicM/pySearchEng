  "text": "Dear Eliot: My friend, M. Louis Gillet, is going to London this week in connection with the French art show and he would like very much to meet you. You will remember his recent article in the Revue des deux Mondes about my Work in Progress (of which he is [sic] literary editor) and I think it is certainly a most remarkable document, full of good will and common sense. You may also remember an article by him in the same review on Ulysses some years ago which provoked a letter of protestation from the late Sir Edmund Gosse. A page of this letter (the whole text of which I have not seen) was exhibited at an exposition de manuscrits of the Revue des Deux Mondes two years ago and caused a certain hilarity. I think you will like to meet him for he is in sympathy with what we are all trying in our different ways to do.",
