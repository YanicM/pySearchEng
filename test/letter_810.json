  "text": "Dear Miss Beach: Here are two enclosures. The card may be answered by a copy of press notices and a prospectus. As for the draft from New York (for which I already signed a receipt) I know nothing of it. I gave your address. We leave here tomorrow morning for Quimper, Hotel de l’Epée. I should be glad if you could send me 1000 francs there as I shall arrive there with only a few hundred. If the New York draft arrives could you forge my name payable to yourself and remit me the rest? Or if not send it to me and I will return it. Am I right in thinking that I am now 2000 francs in your debt? From Quimper I shall write to London for more money, I have £200 there loose in cash, luckily, as I shall need it to continue our journey. I expect to be able to return to Paris at the end of next week but only for a week as I have to go to London. Up to today Camille Jullian’s book has not come. I sent you two loads of books last night. Did you receive the Irish Times? What is wrong about Commerce? Has that dog, who is so fond of raw posteriors, eaten the first batch? Limbes is a good word but the French equivalent is not ventre but entrailles—at least that is what the priest here said while reciting a Hail Mary before a shrine in the Assumption procession. I suppose you have Mr Murry’s new book, reviewed in Criterion? It seems to be a parody of the interior monologue of Ulysses. Is it good? The extract I read is rather feeble I think My brother from Trieste will shortly be coming to Paris. He writes that the interior monologue was used by Tolstoy in Sebastopol, by one of the characters in that story, a soldier. I have no doubt it was. And also by holy Job when seated on the acropolis of Israel. Did I tell you that in giving his award at Dublin Sir John Lavery passed over the portrait of my father (second prize) and gave the first prize to a painting by Mr Keating. The press says the award was ‘keenly criticised’ I should like to have that book of Jullian’s as soon as possible. With kindest regards and thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
