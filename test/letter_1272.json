  "text": "My dear Mr Healy: I think you ought to read the enclosed before you visit Lucia. The writer is my niece Bosschenka Schaurek with whom Lucia is staying and is the only news I have had for a month. From my sister I heard last 3 months ago. When Lucia went to Bray she wrote me she had found a pension at £1.5.0 a week and asked me to send her that and pin money. I sent her regularly £4.0.0 a week since then in two remittances of each. I also wrote regularly and sent her books she asked [for]. She answered fairly regularly but has not written for about 4 weeks though I wrote several times and asked her to reply by return…. But apart from this the letter raises two points. Is it wise for Lucia to remain in such close contact with her cousin who seems to be phthysical? Have Bray and Ireland ceased to do her good and begun to do her harm as it was at Nyon and at Küsnacht? In the form of mental or nervous malady she is subject to, i.e. schizophrenia, the real trouble is not violence or incendiarism or hysterics or simulated suicide. These are hard to deal with but they prove that the person is still alive. The real danger is torpor. The patient falls asleep, so to speak, and prefers to live wholly in his or her inner world, losing more and more contact with the outer world. Disquieted by all this I wrote to Curran and asked his wife or daughter to report to me. In conclusion I have never met either of my nieces for years. They are only 19 and 17, I think, and it may be merely a case of two young persons struggling with a task too heavy for them. With kindest regards and hopes that all is well with yourself and that the visit to Dublin may be beneficial to Kathleen believe me, my dear Mr Healy, Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. I don’t think it would be right at present at least to go into the financial part of this letter with Curran if you see him if time allows you but you certainly [may] discuss all the rest. His mother died a few weeks ago and as he was a very good son he is naturally suffering from so recent a loss. Up to now I have managed to lead her through the wilderness with a rather unsteady hand and a somewhat stumbling foot it may be but nevertheless lead her a little. We expect to be in London on Thursday night, I am not quite sure of our address there so could you let me know where you expect to be on Tuesday and from Tuesday. I have just read in the Irish Times that all the hotels there are full up. J.J.",
