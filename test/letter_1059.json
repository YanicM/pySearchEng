  "text": "Dear McAlmon: It will be all the better if you can arrange with a good American house like the Putnam you mention or Lippincott because then Curtis Brown could arrange simultaneously at this side. He thinks the subscription a very good idea to cover large advertising and also because the book is so long (E.P. says it is 1½ Ulysses) and times so bad. I thought from our telephone talk that you agreed as for yourself if need be. I have also got one of the best agents in London whom I have just seen, Curtis Brown, 6 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, to take the matter in hand. He is sending me a letter to him which I am to sign and he will send copies of this letter to those who are invited to join in the list. Can you send him the address of MacLeish and Brancusi, with the Christian name of the latter. He is writing at once to E.P. for the MS. I hope this is all right. The person I saw at Curtis Brown’s is a Mr Pollinger who knows E.P. well and is, I think, quite trustworthy. He proposes the firm of Martin Seeker. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. If you go away from your present address let him have some permanent one to write to. J.J.",
