  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I was sorry to hear that any relative of yours should have to undergo the operation of iridectomy. It is a dreadful ordeal—or was so for me but there were complications in my case that made it almost impossible. I hope it has been successful. That is the only thing to be said for it. I sent you a copy of 1st act of Esuli and send also a paragraph in the Piccolo of here. Mr Pound wrote to me a postcard a week ago from Venice, saying that if I did not go there before 20 May he would come here. I wrote back express for further details and then received an express from him to say that, owing to Mrs Pound’s state of health, he was leaving Venice for the lake of Garda—so that it seems unlikely that I shall see him after all. As soon as I get his new address I shall send him on the Oxen of the Sun episode which is now being typed to forward to you and to New York. I wrote to a Leipsig firm (Bernhard Tauchnitz, Dresdnerstrasse 5, Leipsig) about my novel and the head of the firm would like to have a copy with a view to including it in the Tauchnitz edition. If you approve of this will you please send him a copy by express registered post. Owing to the depreciation of mark and Lira (I do not think there will be any improvement for a long time) the English edition cannot find continental buyers. For instance only last week the only copy of my book in Trieste was priced at 40 lire! Of course nobody will buy at such a figure. Tauchnitz volumes sell at 3.75 or 4– now and there is more chance of sales at such a price. Of course I mention this as a suggestion and subject to your approval of such cession of continental rights. With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
