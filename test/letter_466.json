  "text": "Dear Sir: I hope you will pardon the liberty I take in writing to you without having the pleasure of knowing you. Mr Ezra Pound told me that you were so kind as to speak well of my play Exiles and to suggest to the Stage Society to put it on. The Society, however, kept the typescript for a year and sent it back without comment. Perhaps you could give me the name of some other society which would be likely to consider it or the name of some manager. I find it very difficult to get what I write printed or produced and this is my excuse for troubling you. In any case let me thank you for the kind interest you have taken in my poor piece.",
