  "text": "Dear Eliot: I have mislaid in moving here the proof you sent me. The opinion here is that it is good but that the slightly larger and heavier one you spoke of sending would be better. Can I have a page? I saw Miss Beach. She says Roth has brought out a new American edition of Ulysses (10,000 copies!?) and she stands by her terms, however, I suppose you saw that the U.S. government has taken the ban off several books from Boccaccio backwards and forwards. Miss Beach is surprised not to have heard from you about the book of essays. I have started work again as well as one can in rather uncertain circumstances. The people to whom I ceded my flat in London let me down very badly. They cried off the contract they had agreed to thereby worsting me out of £100. There is no redress, according to my solicitors. Also according to the same and this Frankfurt colleague there is none in that Michael & James case except that I have to pay fees and expenses in London Vienna and Frankfurt amounting to £48. So that’s that. I hope Mrs Eliot and yourself are well. We are still somewhat knocked about like Cromwell’s ruins. Sincerely yours, James Joyce",
