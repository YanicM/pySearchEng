  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I enclose the final sheet of the first draft of about two thirds of the first section of Part II (2,200 words) which came out like drops of blood. Excuse me for not having written but I have had a dreadful amount of worry all this last month about my son’s projected marriage about which my wife is extremely pessimistic and concerning which I have to proceed like an aged old rat walking over broken bottles. I had to put off my journey to Zurich five different times but am leaving tomorrow with the Gormans and my wife, as he has to have his eyes seen to too. My address will be Elite Carlton Hotel, until Thursday or Friday. I shall write to you at once what Vogt says. I think the piece I sent you is the gayest and lightest thing I have done in spite of the circumstances. I enclose a letter from Antheil, I have consented to cut Byron’s piece for Opera purposes and sign the cuts but no more. I suppose you saw that Mrs Snowden has induced a British Government and a Labour one at that to put up £90,000 in aid of the Beecham and Guinness syndicate. Of course I sent her off through the Paris correspondent of the Daily Herald half a ton of material about Sullivan who is at present dodging shots in Barcelona. This will be all for to-day as H.C.E. remarks but please write to me in Zurich where I shall be glad to have a letter. The scheme of the piece I sent you is the game we used to call Angels and Devils or colours. The Angels, girls, are grouped behind the Angel, Shawn, and the Devil has to come over three times and ask for a colour, if the colour he asks for has been chosen by any girl she has to run and he tries to catch her. As far as I have written he has come twice and been twice baffled. The piece is full of rhythms taken from English singing games. When first baffled vindictively he thinks of publishing blackmail stuff about his father, mother etc etc etc. The second time he maunders off into sentimental poetry of what I actually wrote at the age of nine: My cot alas that dear old shady home where oft in youthful sport I played, upon thy verdant grassy fields all day or lingered for a moment in thy bosom shade etc etc etc etc.’ This is interrupted by a violent pang of tooth ache after which he throws a fit. When he is baffled a second time the girl angels sing a hymn of liberation around Shawn. The page enclosed is still another version of a beautiful sentence from Edgard Quinet which I already refashioned in Transition part one beginning since the days of Hiber and Hairyman etc. E.Q. says that the wild flowers on the ruins of Carthage Numancia etc. have survived the political rises and downfall of Empires. In this case the wild flowers are the lilts of children. Note especially the treatment of the double rainbow in which the iritic colours are first normal and then reversed. With kindest regards and the hope that you are not annoyed with me for my silence Sincerely yours James Joyce",
