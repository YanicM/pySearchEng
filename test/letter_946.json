  "text": "Dear Pound: I have been a long time in replying to both your letters but I had not a moment for I was working all day on Anna Livia (transition 8) which I had to read after in its final amended form, putting in an extra 200 hours on the 1000 I told you of. And after that I did not feel at all well, nervous collapse etc. As regards Covici it is kind of you to think of me. Roth has been pirating the thing in transition also so it is being set up in 3 copies in the U.S.A., 2 being sent to Washington and the 3rd to me so that I may have legal copyright of it. Part 1 has just finished in transition and next month I should begin to publish there serially also Part 3. But I do not intend to publish serially Part 2 or the shorter Part 4 when the 8 or 9 instalments of Part 3 are finished. Miss Beach, of course, has first claim on the right to publish but if my American copyright is secured I shall bear in mind your suggestion. I cannot find the phrase you ask about either in Father Rickeby’s enormous edition of Aquinas or in the French one I have. The scholastic machinery of the process of thought is very intricate, verbum mentale and all the rest of it but I can find no such phrase as you quote. Perhaps it is used in logic or metaphysics. To my mind it does not convey as yet any very precise sense. These philosophical terms are such tricky bombs that I am shy of handling them, being afraid they may go off in my hands. How is your health which is much more important. I heard from Bird that you had to undergo another operation. I hope it is not true or at least that it is well over and done with by now. I have nicely exhausted myself a goodly share of kicks (some of them aimed at me from that well of English undefiled, Tasmania!) and a few halfpennies of encouragement for which I am deeply grateful. I hope Mrs Pound and your boy are well. Friendly regards from us all. With kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. I forgot to send a little epigram I made after our last conversation, I think, about my new book. So here it is. I am writing it legibly. E.P. exults in the extra inch Wherever the ell it’s found But wasn’t J.J. a son of a binch To send him an extra pound? The title I gave it (the epigram) was:",
