  "text": "Dear Giorgio and Helen: We are both glad to hear your good news of general health, that Stevie is so attractive and that you admire the photograph. Mrs Jolas came back on Thursday and her account was so much worse than Mr Healy’s, tallying with an avion letter from Bailly and two requests from Lucia herself to go to a nursing-home that I had her placed in one temporarily on Saturday by telephone. On Monday (yesterday) came a very nice and affectionate letter from Lucia to her mother. I shall not tell you the details of Mrs Jolas’s account unless requested to do so. You have troubles of your own, I understand, and are on holiday and may have a different point of view from mine. After Mr Healy’s letter I was planning to remove her from Ireland by easy stages to within reach of us. On two points all agree 1) that she is much stronger, sturdier etc 2) less unhappy. My wife is of opinion that she should be left to have these two advantages at least. I am less keen on letting her [stay] with Miss Weaver as it turns out that the latter has been for months past in collusion with Eileen ‘not to write this to Paris etc’, keeping me in ignorance of all the sordid squalor of the case and of the warning of the authorities that their next step would be to commit her or intern her. I was told always ‘she is getting on fine and Miss Weaver, as with her other female charms, walked blue-eyed and primmouthed into my sister’s booby-trap. I am not sending any of Lucia’s letters. I expect a letter from Curran brought about the transfer. If so I may write again tomorrow as there is a second boat on the 18. Lucia is quite sunburnt, too, it seems. Soupault still away. Any chance of having a good photo of Master Ringlets, dressed please. After which you may send a nudist group of all the household, including Blackaboots, arranged in the order of their lastification. And thanks for your cable on Independence, Dependence, and Interdependence Day. And here is the N.Y.H. with Mrs Bailly’s niece modestly beside the new Irish envoy. Ay, I note you have moved from Boost and Worstworld Avenue to Booth and Wildwold Avenue and that you will autumn in Bleak and Wetwind Avenue before wintering in Block and Woolworth Avenues. My address is 7 Rapp, Bosquet, Pont Deloge, Dominique and Valentin Avenues, Paris (R.7) Tantissime cose Babbo P.S. Just ran down to the hairdresser’s to get shorn and ran up again. Don’t jump to conclusions about Lucia: or reply that there is only one simple solution. Severe reclusion was tried in Nyon and, though it kept her out of harm’s way, it was a calamitous failure. Total separation from her parents has been tried for the second time and you see the result. I forgot to say that between Mrs Jolas’s arrival and Bailly’s mail I had a wire from Eileen and Lucia asking for 2000 francs at once. I telephoned Curran to find out and if Lucia was in difficulties to pay and notify me. She was not, luckily. A few days ago Lucia sent me a song called Dublin Bay about a certain Roy Neil who runs away with his bride from Dublin. They are wrecked and lost at sea, the bride singing ‘O, why did we leave sweet Dublin Bay!’ In replying to this I said (Giorgio will translate). Ho capito il latino. E se fossi convinto che quello sarebbe per il tuo bene ma proprio bene malgrado tutto, ed a rischio di tutto … Ma ho sempre paura delle aringhe. Some days ago I bought a MS copy of Pomes Penyeach with her lettrines and sent it to Mr Healy to present to the Library of the University in Galway in my name. In her letter to her mother Lucia writes that some days ago she went to the Library of Dublin University (one of the 4 largest in the British Isles) and presented to it one of my letters to her which she had found particularly interesting. It will not be very amusing for Giorgio to hear this, less so for me, though behind the impulsive gesture there there [sic] is something I recognize. And do not imagine anything bad has happened. Not yet and it won’t now, I suppose. B",
