  "text": "Dear Budgen: I am here and am faced with a terribly difficult problem about Lucia. After 7 months of the clinic she seems on the verge of collapse. The doctors can make no diagnostic. Completely stumped. You can perhaps help me. Some time ago you wrote me of some case you heard of. It was a friend? and your letter spoke of a treatment for reduction of white blood corpuscles. Lucia has 4 times the normal number of these. They say there must be a source of infection. They have put her to tests for syphilis, tuberculosis, glands, etc., but the result is always the same, negative. If this seat of infection could be found and treated they think the battle might turn. If you have time drop me a line and give me any details you know of. With friendly greetings sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. I note that your royal reader has been and gone and engaged his royal self with a Greek Princess. Please arrange for the removal of the six of the blood royal who stand between him and the throne to enable you and me to become fashionable awfurs.",
