  "text": "Dear Mr Spicer-Simson Many thanks for so kindly remembering me and I am glad your Sterne night went off so well. I would like to have been present and I hope your club may pay a like honour to some other fellow-countrymen of mine who stand higher than L.S, for example, Jonathan Swift (who could preside over a very fantastic night) or Oliver Goldsmith. There is a very good reason for my apparent rudeness. While I was in Dublin I had to oversee the rebuilding of a kind of hall and between the snow and the damp and rain I got a bad attack of rheumatic inflammation of the iris of the eye. I had to leave Ireland at once (with black bandages over both my eyes) and come back here where I was in bed in a half-dark room for close on two months. Had it not been for my sister who travelled with me across Europe I should certainly have ended under the wheels of some train or car. I was only an hour in Paris on the way back. I am all right again now and am very busy correcting the proofs of my new book Dubliners which is to come out in a few weeks. As you were kind enough to express an interest in it I will be glad to let you know more about it if you will drop me a line but I donâ€™t care to do so now as I am afraid it might look like trumpeting my own wares. Thanks also for your card which I shall add to my collection. If you did anything for the Sterne programme in the way of illustration I should like a copy too. I enclose some extracts of press reviews of a book of my verses which came out in London some three years ago. I regret that it is so incomplete as I forgot to have the later ones added. Have you ever heard of a Mr Adolph Mann, a composer? I received this morning a printed copy of one of the songs in my book set by him. Another composer, Mr Molyneux Palmer, has also done eight of them and a Mr Reynolds, who is musical critic to the Belfast Evening Telegraph has done two. It is a pity I live so far away that I cannot follow events very closely. I may be in Paris this summer on my way to Ireland or perhaps in the autumn. If I do I shall look you up. Always at your service and with kind regards to Mrs Spicer-Simson Yours very sincerely James Joyce",
