  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I understand that both Miss Monnier and Miss Beach have written to you to come over for the séance on the twentysixth which for all I know may celebrate the close of my Paris career, just as that of the 7th of December, 1921, opened it. Everything is at sixes and sevens here. Both Colum and his wife are being treated by Dr Fontaine, the former for general fatigue, and the latter for a sprained ankle. Gorman is confined to bed or practically so and will not be about again for five or six weeks…. Gilbert is leaving Paris in a day or two for the south, so that I have nobody to help me with the reading except Léon who however, not having read a word I have written except the piece he revised for Babou, has no idea what my book is about or what I want. I take up some of my daughter-in-law’s time trying to copy into one large book the worst of my illegibly scrawled notes. McGreevy has also left Paris. Some person or persons gave him an annuity of 300 lbs a year to do original work, and he has gone to Ireland, via Italy. This flat is still unlet and my landlord who has lost several millions in the general crack, has hung out a gaudy sign. Three more banks broke this morning. My wife has had a series of three or four colds. So has my son. The worst that is wrong with me is that my hair, which has become very thin, I don’t mean rare but thin, keeps falling into my eyes, and as I cannot dispose of three thousand francs to pay my dentist, I keep on juggling with the broken plate in my mouth. This was a novel occupation when I began it in London last August, but I am thoroughly tired of it now…. My second objection is quite trivial. For my convenience I wear tinted glasses in the street even when the day is darkish. Nobody minds that here, but I am sure that on the Londoners I shall make the impression that I have committed some crime and am trying to sneak around in disguise. However I deserve all this on account of my many iniquities. So to conclude I shall probably go into a small furnished flat in London and then perhaps go to Zurich and then perhaps go back to London and then perhaps go somewhere else and then perhaps come back to Paris. My furniture meanwhile being stored, though where I am to get the money to move out of the house the Almighty and Omnipotent Ruler of the Universe alone knows seeing as how I have just sufficient funds to enable me to exist for about three days more. I cannot think of anything else of a dreary nature to add to this. The only good news is that Mrs Colum who seems to be a very efficient business woman…. is confident that she can arrange for an American publisher named Knopf to bring out … an anthology of mine for which she expects they will pay me an advance. The second good point is that I think if the séance of the twentysixth is successful it will probably break the back of the english resistance to Work in Progress as they usually follow a Paris lead over there. I hope you will let me hear from you what you think of this bewildering situation.",
