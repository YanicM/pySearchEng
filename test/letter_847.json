  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I wonder what weather you are having. The evening before we left Paris my whole family was caught in the Bois under a tree by a violent storm. Luckily they escaped with a drenching. I did not go with them as I went to pay my doctors. Dr Borsch’s secretary would not take any money. It was just as well for the concierge developed a mania for bills I had not foreseen—even producing one as a stirrup-cup which I bade him keep for my sake. Immediately after I left Paris it was visited by terrific storms the fragments of which flew over here. We have had wind, rain, hail, thunder, lightning etc and as my eye was troubling me yesterday we leave tomorrow for Rouen, Hôtel de la Poste. Even here I cannot escape Shaun and I added or changed about a hundred things in Anna Livia which I sent on to Miss Beach who is holding the MS. There will be an article about me in the next Revue des Deux Mondes. My wife has been very uneasy here but we did not like to go away in a hurry and yesterday was Lucia’s birthday (S. Anna: her name is Lucia Anna) and today is my son’s. Maupassant was born here but his mother concealed the fact. The first café we went into had a board up with: Her fales skandrinavisk on it and flew a Danish, a Norwegian and Swedish flag. While I was returning from an excursion to S. Valéry the idea for the last watch of Shaun came into my head. But I suppose I ought to ease off. When you return to London I shall explain why I did not send the typescript. With kindest regards and hopes that Donner and Thor are far from you.",
