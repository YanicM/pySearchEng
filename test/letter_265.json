  "text": "Dearest No letter! only a short rude one from Stannie. For God’s sake let me be spared any of the old trouble or I shall end in a madhouse. Try, dear, till your lover comes back to make things run smoothly. I can write no more. What does he fight with me for? I am doing my best for you all. Please, dear, give him plenty to eat and let him be comfortable. Don’t bother him about debts: and for God’s sake don’t bother me about them. I sent you pictures. Get him to put them up in the kitchen, the big one opposite the fire. Put up well. No letter! Now I am sure my girlie is offended at my filthy words. Are you offended, dear, at what I said about your drawers? That is all nonsense, darling. I know they are as spotless as your heart. I know I could lick them all over, frills, legs and bottom. Only I love in my dirty way to think that in a certain part they are soiled. It is all nonsense, too, dear, about buggering you. It is only the dirty sound of the word I like, the idea of a shy beautiful young girl like Nora pulling up her clothes behind and revealing her sweet white girlish drawers in order to excite the dirty fellow she is so fond of; and then letting him stick his dirty red lumpy pole in through the split of her drawers and up up up in the darling little hole between her plump fresh buttocks. Darling, I came off just now in my trousers so that I am utterly played out. I cannot go to the G.P.O. though I have three letters to post. To bed—to bed! Goodnight, Nora mia! Jim",
