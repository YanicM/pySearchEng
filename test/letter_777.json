  "text": "Dear Friend: Send the books without delay. I have already spoken of you to Larbaud and Crémieux. Use my name when you write to Seldes and Eliot. Also send a copy to Lauro de Bosis and Enzo Ferrieri, editor of Il Convegno, 24 via Santo Spirito, Milan. Your book will certainly be appreciated. Who will not be able to appreciate the honourable Dr Coprosich (sanctificetur nomen tuum) ‘who even washed his face’? With such a name he should have performed very different ablutions! A propos of names: I have given the name of Signora Schmitz to the protagonist of the book I am writing. Ask her, however, not to take up arms, either of steel or fire, since the person involved is the Pyrrha of Ireland (or rather of Dublin) whose hair is the river beside which (her name is Anna Liffey) the seventh city of Christianity springs up, the other six being Basovizza, Clapham Junction, Rena Vecia, Limehouse, S. Odorico in the Vale of Tears and San Giacomo in Monte di Pietà. Return the enclosed clipping after you have read it. Cordial greetings to Signora Schmitz and to yourself. My best to you.",
