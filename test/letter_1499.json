  "text": "Dear Sirs: I shall be obliged if on receipt of this letter or as soon after as may be possible you will cable to me at the U.S. embassy in Vichy through the State Department at Washington whatever sum of royalties may be due to me on the 1 September deducting the U.S. income tax and the literary agent’s commission. No money should be sent to me by personal cheques or to credit of my account. This has been blocked here as a reprisal against similar measures in Great Britain where my other source of income is (almost incredibly) blocked too. British subjects in this country are under the protection of the U.S. embassy since the rupture of diplomatic relations between France and Great Britain. Mr Robert Murphy, acting chargé d’affaires in the absence of Mr William Bullitt, received me the other day in Vichy and told me that the course I have indicated is the only and proper course to be pursued.",
