  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am sorry to have to trouble you with a request. I am afraid you will find it tedious but I think you ought to read the proofs of instalment 4. I send you herewith the final MS additions and the proof should be read with both, my handwriting will be more familiar than my son’s, the final additions are in green ink. I shall correct the proofs from the perhaps faulty copy in Elliot Paul’s possession at the same time. It will be sent to you in a few days. Also if any of my additions or changes have not appeared in instalments 1, 2 and 3 I should be glad if you would indicate page and line, referring to transition. I leave tomorrow for Holland and will send my address. Mr Donald Friede, owner of Boni and Liveright, offered me this morning $2000 down and 15% royalties to publish my new book, but I declined. As regards that book itself and its future completion I have asked Miss Beach to get into closer relations with James Stephens. I started reading one of his last books yesterday Deirdre. I thought he wrote The Return of the Hero which I liked. His Charwoman’s Daughter is now out in French. He is a poet and Dublin born. Of course he would never take a fraction of the time or pains I take but so much the better for him and me and possibly for the book itself. If he consented to maintain three or four points which I consider essential and I showed him the threads he could finish the design. JJ and S (the colloquial Irish for John Jameson and Son’s Dublin whisky) would be a nice lettering under the title. It would be a great load off my mind. I shall think this over first and wait until the opposition becomes more general and pointed. Dulce et decorum est prope mare sedere—boglatin for it is a sweet and seemly thing to sit down by the sea.",
