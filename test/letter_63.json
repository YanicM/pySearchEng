  "text": "Dear Stannie I went to the Berlitz School yesterday. No vacancy. The director read the letter and could not understand, he said. Perhaps the director-general in Vienna had engaged me. He would write. He also gave me a letter to Gilford which I enclosed to that person yesterday with a letter asking for immediate explanation. His letter to Gilford was— This letter does not look to me a letter from a stranger to a stranger and I am sure there is a mistake somewhere. The director said if I could stay on in Zürich for a week or ten days he would certainly get me a post either in Switzerland or in Italy and pay my expenses on from here and that if the director-general at Vienna had engaged me through the agency he could advance me money. I am awaiting the result Jim",
