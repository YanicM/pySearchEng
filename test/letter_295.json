  "text": "Dear Eileen Am glad to hear from Stannie you are getting on well. We may or may not go to Udine on Corpus Christi. This month I have 300 crowns rent to pay. Possibly we shall be in this flat also next year as the administrator told me he intends to try to bring Picciola and myself to an understanding. Did you get the Piccolo I sent with my article on Parnell? Did the Serravallo people see it or do they read only the labels on pill boxes? Mrs Schmitz leaves for London next month and wishes to see you here before she goes as if she does not engage you she will bring back a girl from London. Let me know about what date you are likely to motor in here and I shall arrange an interview. The arrangement would be this. Every afternoon at 1.30 you would meet her daughter Letizia in the via Madonna del Mare outside the girls’ school, go with her to Servola, lunch there with her, take tea in the afternoon and remain there till seven. You will have a season ticket on the train. Your mornings and Sundays and half holidays are your own. You would also study piano accompaniment to her violin. What would you think I should ask as a fee (monthly). Mrs Schmitz asked me but I said I would write to you first. Let me know by return. I advise you to say nothing of this possible engagement yet to the Serravallos as if they intend to take lessons during the winter they might want the afternoons. If your afternoons are taken they will have to do with two mornings. The other five mornings of the week you can use for your piano and singing. Any more ham a-coming? I have had a glimpse of some letters that came from Dublin by which I understand a good three-cornered fight is beginning. I think and said before that Charlie and his family should take a labourer’s cottage and live in it with his wife and children, alone. I have no news from my publisher to whom I write regularly every first Friday. I sent copies of my article to Pappie, May and Charlie which were unacknowledged but hope to send shortly an old pair of trousers to Dublin which is more in their line. I have bought a 160 crown American desk at which I am writing. The skeleton chairs are gone and are being covered in elephant hide. We were at Barbiere di Siviglia. Georgie was tested today and I am going to order glasses for him now. Where is the horse fair in Udine? Arrivederci perhaps on C.C. (if I can manage). Otherwise later. Salve! Jim",
