  "text": "Dear Stannie I am surprised that you have not written to me as you said you would or sent back my manuscript. I must ask you to exert your imagination a little with regard to me. My average number of lessons (and what lessons!) per day will now be from 8 to 10 and I am trying to finish Dubliners. So if you and Aunt Josephine are piqued by my not writing you must not forget these facts. I really wish you would answer me promptly, money or no money. I am much obliged for your careful criticisms of my stories. Your comparison of them with certain others is somewhat dazzling. The authors you mention have such immense reputations that I am afraid you may be wrong. Lermontoff says, apropros of the Confessions of Rousseau, that they were vitiated by the fact that Rousseau read them to his friends. I hardly think, arguing from the conditions in which they are written, that these stories can be superlatively good. I wish I could talk to you fully on this as on many other subjects. Your remark that Counterparts shows a Russian ability in taking the reader for an intracranial journey set me thinking what on earth people mean when they talk of ‘Russian’. You probably mean a certain scrupulous brute force in writing and, from the few Russians I have read, this does not seem to be eminently Russian. The chief thing I find in nearly all Russians is a scrupulous instinct for caste. Of course, I don’t agree with you about Turgénieff. He does not seem to me to be very much superior to Korolenko (have you read any of his?) or Lermontoff. He is a little dull (not clever) and at times theatrical. I think many admire him because he is ‘gentlemanly’ just as they admire Gorky because he is ‘ungentlemanly’. Talking of Gorky what do you think of him? He has a great name with Italians. As for Tolstoy I disagree with you altogether. Tolstoy is a magnificent writer. He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical! He is head and shoulders over the others. I don’t take him very seriously as a Christian saint. I think he has a very genuine spiritual nature but I suspect that he speaks the very best Russian with a St Petersburg accent and remembers the Christian name of his great-great-grandfather (this, I find, is at the bottom of the essentially feudal art of Russia). I see that he wrote a 13 column letter to The Times of London attacking governments. Even the English ‘liberal’ papers are indignant. Not merely does he attack armaments, he even alludes to the Tsar as a ‘weak-minded Hussar officer, standing below the intellectual level of most of his subjects, grossly superstitious and of coarse tastes’. The English liberals are shocked: they would call him vulgar but that they know he is a prince. A writer in the Illustrated London News sneers at Tolstoy for not understanding WAR. ‘Poor dear man!’ he says. Now, damn it, I’m rather good-tempered but this is a little bit too much. Did you ever hear such impudence? Do they think the author of Resurrection and Anna Karenin is a fool? Does this impudent, dishonourable journalist think he is the equal of Tolstoy, physically, intellectually, artistically or morally? The thing is absurd. But when you think of it, it’s cursedly annoying also. Perhaps that journalist will undertake to revise Tolstoy more fully—novels, stories, plays and all. I agree with you, however, about Maupassant. He is an excellent writer. His tales are sometimes a little slipshod but that was hardly to be avoided, given the circumstances of his life. To return to myself. Do you think it is likely an English publisher will publish Dubliners? Mr T. Fisher Unwin, who ‘regretted &c …’ my verses has an advertisement in today’s Daily Mail for Florence Warden’s new thrilling story The House by the River. The advertisement begins with a quotation from some sensitive reviewer ‘Up and down your spine’ in moderate capitals. I am sure that in ‘private life’, as they say of the lady highkickers, Mr T. Fisher Unwin is a most ‘cultured’ person. Sometimes I ask myself, when similar enormities reach me, is it worth while conquering this. On the other hand, as perhaps Mr Magee and Mr Gogarty are beginning to suspect, my nature is artistic and I cannot be happy so long as I try to stifle it. You did not seem to take my statement—viz, that my present absurd life is no longer possible for me—very seriously. Therefore I repeat the remark: and I may also remind you that I have a habit (an inconvenient one for myself, it seems) of following up a conviction by an act. If I once convince myself that this kind of life is suicidal to my soul, I will make everything and everybody stand out of my way as I did before now. However I am doing what I can to live without causing unhappiness to the few people for whom I have affection. The child has got no name yet, though he will be two months old on Thursday next. He is very fat and very quiet. I don’t know who he’s like. He’s rather like that pudgy person of two years old who frowns at the camera in my first photograph but he has the ‘companion’s’ eyes. How is that brisk idiot, by the way? He seems to be very healthy in spite of his paternal inheritance. I think a child should be allowed to take his father’s or mother’s name at will on coming of age. Paternity is a legal fiction. Wouldn’t it be awful if I had to hawk my son from one beggarly lodgings to another, from land to land? I mean, of course, for his sake. I hope to Christ he won’t have to make allowances for me when he begins to think. I send you the ninth story of Dubliners, namely An Encounter which might bear the dedication to the author of The Voyage of the Ophir. (Return it at once.) You overrate this writer greatly, I think. Do you remember how I shocked you by deriving him from Lytton and Disraeli. I should have been sent to school in France. I don’t like to think of some prose which I have written. But, instead, I was taught by Father Tommy Meagher and Ruskin. Have you heard of the earthquake in Calabria? I enriched the fund for the sufferers by a crown. Some phenomena of nature terrify me. It is strange that a person can be morally intrepid, as I certainly am, and abjectly cowardly in the physical sense. Some nights I look at my girl’s arms with pity and think that perhaps my politeness is also a form of physical cowardice. How I would like, if only I could secure a footing, to plunge any young people I knew into a bath of spontaneous happiness. I would like to see a lot of different young natures tumbling over each other. This desire however may be egoistic. It is quite certain that in the past, for example with the ‘companion’ and with Gogarty and Byrne, I behaved as I did (to G’s and B’s astonishment, unselfishly) because my own nature would have been offended had I behaved otherwise. By the way, how is May? Jim P.S. No letter again today. What’s up now?",
