  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have been so plagued with nerves, toothache etc all last week that I could not write. Here is the authorisation you ask for. I agree with anything you may propose about the English edition…. I received Mr Bennett’s article and sent him a word of thanks. For the purposes of sales his article is not very useful as it does not give the name and address of the publisher. I always look for this first of all in an article, then at its length and finally at its signature. I wonder if any criticism of the book will be published—apart from these articles. Mr Murry’s, as I suspected, broke the blockade. There are some loose sheets of Ulysses lying about. If I sent them to you could you, when you have time, put in the corrections you speak of That would leave me free for the correction of the text only. But the printer says the changes are to be as few as possible. I am afraid you will have a very tiresome correspondence with him. He pays little attention to personal or commercial interests (his own or others) and is moved chiefly by amour propre. Heartrending telegrams mean nothing to him. He will reply (about some totally different matter) three days later and in conclusion beg you to deign to accept the assurance of his most perfect consideration. I enclose a letter from Mr Pinker’s son. I replied that you have the English rights and no abridged edition is to be published. The manager of the Chelsea Book Club states that he is commissioned by a theatrical manager in London, a Mr Peacock, to pay me an advance of £2000 for a new three act play. I could not write three pages of it. In fact I have decided that I must have some rest as the events of the past four months coming after years of work have exhausted me—especially the last five weeks as I was momentarily expecting to hear of the assassination of my family in Ireland whither they had gone very much against my wish though I consented as it was a visit of my children to grandparents who perhaps might not see them again. As I foresaw they had to flee from the west of Ireland lying flat in a railway carriage amid a fusillade. However, thank goodness, they came back safely. I am trying to settle my daughter in some summer school and as soon as that is done I shall leave Paris for a month or so, entrusting my son with the task (for which I am unequal) of finding an apartment. I expect to be in London in a week or ten days from now and afterwards to go to the sea.",
