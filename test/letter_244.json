  "text": "I send you copy of Sinn Fein with two stories by my rival, the latest Irish genius, James Stephens. Ask Nora if she likes the style of Irish gowns in the pictures. If so I could get her the patterns. The politician is Cruise O’Brien and the poet is Colm. I wrote M today sending an estimate for installation of electric light. Also corporation scale of charges per British unit: this could be converted by an electrical engineer into foreign units if there is a difference. I have been unable to conclude anything definite today about licence or lease. Hope you are better. Did you send cigars to Cowell? M’s delay in coming is most untoward. Jim",
