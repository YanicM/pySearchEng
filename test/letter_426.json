  "text": "Dear Mr Huebsch: I have heard from Miss Weaver that you are trying to bring out my novel before the end of the year. I sincerely hope that you will do so and that my corrections reached you in time. In the English edition slips are to be inserted containing a few extracts from the press notices of my book Dubliners (at least in the review copies). In case you approve of this idea I am asking my agent to send you one. If, however, the book be delayed beyond the end of the year I should be much obliged if the date on the frontispiece be printed as 1916. I suppose you have now received from Mr Pinker my adherence to the terms of contract proposed by you. I confirm the same by the present letter to save time. As I am anxiously waiting for the publication of the book I shall be much obliged if you will kindly cable to my agent when it is published. I would beg you also to forward the letter which accompanies this to Mr Byrne Hackett whose address I do not know. Finally I thank you for your promptness and energy in arranging the publication of my book and wish you good success in your venture.",
