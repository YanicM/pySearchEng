  "text": "Dear Miss Monroe: I received your kind letter of May last but I did not receive any number of your review containing either my first or my second group of verses. I should be glad to have copies and, in view of the exceptional circumstances, may I ask you perhaps to send me a second copy. Mr Pound also wrote that he had sent me a copy of one number which contained verses by him and also that number never reached me. Many thanks for your kind references to my novel. I am glad it gave you some pleasure. The enclosed English press notices may interest you. My play Exiles will appear in autumn. I am sorry to say I have not been able to do much this year. I have been very ill with my eyes and fear I shall never get well in this bad climate. Sincerely yours, James Joyce",
