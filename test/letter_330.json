  "text": "Dear Brother, Thanks for letter. If C is sent away I shall of course apply for and try to get his job: but I don’t think any move in that direction should be made while C has the position. If they want to dismiss him let them dismiss him and be damned to him and them. Then if they want anybody to teach the sons of bitches broken English I suppose I am good enough for that. I have heard the same talk from Schmitz, Schreiber and Vidacovich for the last three years. Let the board pension him first. I cannot go sneaking behind his back for his job. In any case you can [tell] Veneziani that I am always ready to receive—ergo money also ready to take C’s job when he’s out of it—not before. Please send me verbatim account of Symons review of C.M. as I want to send it to Mazzoni (Guido) who has promised to take up my case in Padua. I am, dear brother, Yours as always, James + P.S. Could you lend me a florin? P.P.S. I will send it back.",
