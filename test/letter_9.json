  "text": "Dear Mother I enclose a letter I had a day or two ago from Mr Yeats. I answered saying I had left my manuscripts in Ireland but sent him a poem. I have at my disposal a position in the Ecole Berlitz, beginning at 150 francs a month (£7–10–0), but I should be at the school all day. However I am giving two or three lessons a week to a M Douce who gives me or will give me 20 or 25 francs a month (£1 or £1–5–0). The weather is milder. I hardly know if I have anything to say. I received both your letters and see that I have alarmed you very much. My curious state has been followed by an equally curious weariness which is however painless. For instance I would prefer you wrote and I read. Write again if you like and say if I should go home for Christmas. Please ask Stannie to go to Hodges, Figgis, say I am here and have written to him to order ‘A Book of British Song’ by I don’t know whom, published recently by John Murray, London. I would like to go asleep now yet I did not get up till eleven, and it is now only two. I also feel as if I should not seek to express but simply listen to people. I am afraid I shall not easily settle down. I should not like to live in Paris but I should like to divide my existence. I shall set you some music in a few days which I want you to learn. M Douce will give me 10s/, the ‘Express’ £1–1–0, and the Academy, I daresay, £1–0–0: that is £2–11–0. Could you get a set of teeth for that? Do not be offended please because I cannot write. Jim",
