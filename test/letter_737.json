  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for your letter and the article in the Manchester Guardian. I shall send a few lines of formal thanks to Mr Gwynn who after sixteen years of literary criticism has discovered my existence. One half of his article is taken almost verbally from the text of Ulysses, the other half consists of phrases which I myself set in circulation. They now come back to me. You ask me to whom I wish copies to be sent. The copies of Ulysses which I presented to certain of my fellowcountrymen and fellowcountrywomen were either unacknowledged or locked up or given away or lent or stolen or sold and, it seems, in all cases unread. Nevertheless it remains part of my policy to inflict notices of myself upon the recipients. Therefore if the stamping is not too tiresome I would ask you to be kind enough to send copies to…. I hope Mr Jaloux’s article will appear on 1 April—a pleasant anniversary. During my illness I think I managed to arrange for an article in La Revue des Deux Mondes. When I have got one into La Revue de France I shall cease—to the relief of my Paris admirers. In my opinion however my name would be absent from the Manchester Guardian (as from the Irish Who’s Who and the official history of the Irish Literary Movement and the playbills of the Abbey Theatre) but for certain articles in English reviews and these would not have been published but for previous articles in French reviews. Please present my compliments to Miss Marsden. I hope you will have a pleasant Easter. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
