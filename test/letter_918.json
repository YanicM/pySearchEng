Please send me a list of your doubtful points and can you write your letters typed on account of my sight. What is the fare and the time of the train journey to Paris from Witten. Surely they will allow us to meet before the translation comes out! Have you done the end of the Oxen of the Sun? Sincerely yours James Joyce",
