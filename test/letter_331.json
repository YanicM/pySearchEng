  "text": "Dear Mr Mathews Thanks for note and a/c received: and am glad to hear about the anthology. Have sold 12 copies of the 24 received. I write to ask you whether you will take on immediately the publication of my famous book Dubliners on either of the following terms: i) The whole book to be printed here in Trieste, proofs corrected etc at my expense. ii) Printed in London at my expense or at our joint expense, my royalties of course [to] be computed in proportion to your risk. My only condition (outside the financial one) is that the book is brought out immediately. I intend to write a preface for it, narrating its eight years of adventure and final burningâ€”a unique story out of which a publisher could make a great advertisement for it. I may add that I am prepared to take on in either case 110 copies for sale here at trade price. You will oblige me by answering by return as I intend to push on the matter. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
