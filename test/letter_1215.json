  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: We hope you have quite recovered from your accident. When are you likely to be back in Zurich or are you there already? I wish we could meet you in order to discuss our great difficulty with you. We found Lucia after 7 months of the clinic almost on the verge of collapse. Utter despair. The doctor says after all that time he can make no diagnostic. They are helpless in the case. The only hold she seems to have on life is her affection for us. She is under restraint, that is, her windows are barred, and she is always surveillée. But I feel if she stays there she will simply fade out. We are alone here, not knowing a soul. Our kind regards to you both. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
