  "text": "Dear Mr Gorman: Please thank Mrs Gorman for kindly visiting that house but from the description of the entrance it would not suit. I return P.C.’s letter but nothing of the kind I suggested seems to have been done. I enclose 4 letters, one to Sullivan, three to me which will show what I have been doing. I was with Kahn at the opera this week, with Beecham last week and as you see Richard Guinness is coming over for the last performance. If you are coming wire me beforehand. The Scala of Milan yesterday invited Sullivan to sing Guillaume Tell there in the full version which Lauri-Volpi cut by half and also Tannhauser. He goes to Lyon, Marseilles and Barcelona for a few months and then the Paris opera is reviving La Juive for him in February. Please send me back these letters by return though you may copy them if you wish—they are themselves copies. Have you got your copy of H.C.E. Babou has the receipt from the P.O. It was sent registered two months ago c/o your banker. We hope to see you both over here. Our kindest regards to you both in the meantime. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
