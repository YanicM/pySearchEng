  "text": "Dear Stannie I have read in the ‘Standard’ of London that Grant Richards is bankrupt for £53,100–0–0. What do you think I ought to do? I want my verses to be published in the autumn. I have finished Chaps XV. XVI. XVII. XVIII. XIX. XX and XXI. I am now at Chap XXII. I would write another ‘Dubliner’ if I knew definitely the result of ‘Hallow Eve’. I do not think I can write any more verse. I have great difficulty getting a room as the landladies shunt us as soon as they perceive Nora’s state: but I don’t care a rambling curse of Christ what any one does or what happens. I can’t write any more now because Nora is dabbing me with inky paper. I have been waiting for a letter confirming your news of E.H. Nora is positive that you are making a mistake. As you may have heard I am entering for a missing letter puzzle in ‘Ideas’. There are to be 48 words in batches of six. As yet 42 words have appeared and I have solved all. I am waiting for the last six. The prize is £250. I shall send you a sealed and registered letter containing a copy of my answers. You are not to open the letter but keep it carefully. In case I solve all or nearly all I shall also seal and register my letter to the paper so that if they do not give me a prize I can take an action against them. My entering for this competition has kept me a very long time on Chapter XXII but you may expect to receive the chapters of the University College episode in a few weeks. I have written to Grant Richards asking for my manuscript and if he is done for I shall send a copy of the verses to John Lane as I want them published by the end of the year. I am writing (imagine!) a summary of English literature for a Berlitz Book for the Japanese: five or six pages. The German teacher here is going to Japan. You must be surprised to get such bald letters from me but then you see that I am very busy. Skeffington, poor youth, is in a bad way. What surprises me is that these wise ones should have said that there is money in my novel. I hardly believe there is. It is a mistake for you to imagine that my political opinions are those of a universal lover: but they are those of a socialistic artist. I cannot tell you how strange I feel sometimes in my attempt to live a more civilised life than my contemporaries. But why should I have brought Nora to a priest or a lawyer to make her swear away her life to me? And why should I superimpose on my child the very troublesome burden of belief which my father and mother superimposed on me? Some people would answer that while professing to be a socialist I am trying to make money: but this is not quite true at least as they mean it. If I made a fortune it is by no means certain that I would keep it. What I wish to do is to secure a competence on which I can rely, and why I expect to have this is because I cannot believe that any State requires my energy for the work I am at present engaged in. If you look back on my relations with friends and relatives you will see that it was a youthfully exaggerated feeling of this maldisposition of affairs which urged me to pounce upon the falsehood in their attitude towards me as an excuse for escape. The English teacher here says I think of nothing but eating: and in reality I do not eat much at all. He says I will die of a brain disease: whereas in spite of the afflicting delicacy of that organism it does not seem to me to be diseased in any way. He says I will die a Catholic because I am always moping in and out of the Greek Churches and am a believer at heart: whereas in my opinion I am incapable of belief of any kind. Have you ever reflected what an important sea the Mediterranean is? In the canal here the boats are lined along the quays. They are the same old galley-looking affairs which were in use during the Middle Age. The men row the row-boats from the standing posture. Inside the great bosom of the prow every sailing ship has an image of some saviour, Saint Nicholas or the Madonna or Jesus walking on the waters. Perhaps the Baltic will replace the Mediterranean but till now importance seems to have been in the direct ratio of nearness to the Mediterranean. I have sent in solutions of the puzzle—all correct but owing to distance and time a day late. I have finished the ‘history of Eng. Literature’ for this German chap. I did not write because I was expecting a letter from you. I am reading Ecclesiastical History in the intervals of teaching. I am thinking of studying grammar. I think it would be a better whetstone for youth than geometry. I have written to Grant Richards and expect a reply. In my history of literature I have given the highest palms to Shakespeare, Wordsworth and Shelley. Have you read Turgénieff’s ‘Lear of the Steppes.’ He does many things well and is useful technically but in European literature he has not so high a place as you seem to think he has. Jim",
