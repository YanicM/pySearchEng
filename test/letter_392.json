  "text": "Dear Mr Mencken Excuse me for having delayed so long before replying to your last letter. I called at the British Consulate here and was told that Mr Abbott had been temporarily transferred to Basel. I wrote to him there, conveying your regards to him, giving him your address and adding that you would be glad to hear from him. I regret to say that I have no news about myself. It seems that my agent finds it very difficult to induce any publisher to take on my novel: and, as for my play Exiles Mr Pound tells me it is almost impossible for the English stage. However he has written an article about it which, he writes me, will appear in the next number (November or February) of Drama (Chicago). He is a most active and generous friend, as you see. A few days ago a young Russian friend of mine here, Mr Geller, brought me a monologue of his and asked me if I knew of any review which might take it. Your review seemed to me to be the only one likely to consider it and so I advised him to send it on to you. He told me he would do so and perhaps it may suit your review. If I have anything of my own I shall bear in mind your kind invitation. But I am very discouraged by the endless difficulties which my writings seem to provoke. With kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
