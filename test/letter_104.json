  "text": "Dear Stannie I was very much surprised to receive yesterday a telegraphed order for 24 crowns. I thought you might be living on ‘pieces’ so I sent you the money, hearing you were ill. I hope you didn’t deprive yourself of food to send me the money. There is a post as English teacher open for you in this school from the 20th October next which the director offers you through me. Your salary would be 40 crowns a week (a crown is 10d) for a maximum of 40 hours a week. Extra lessons at the rate of 1 crown a lesson. Your travelling expenses 3rd class would be repaid to you on your arrival here. You would have to sign a contract for six months after you arrive. If you could not raise the fare I could send you 100 crowns (£4–3–4) to cover your expenses. I have spoken to my landlady who has a room vacant next ours. You could take it (she will keep it disengaged till your reply comes) and board with the family here as Nora does or take your meals out as I do. If you do not care to live with us I could find you board and lodgings for 70 crowns a month. As the director is keeping the post open for you, I must ask you to answer immediately. You might do no more than winter here if you have other plans in Ireland: and a few months of the best season (opera and carnival) in Trieste might not be too disagreeable to you. At the same time if you are disinclined do not imagine that I will consider your refusal an affront. I expect that when Dubliners is published I may be able to help you as well as myself. I send you by this evening’s post the tenth story A Mother which you are to copy and return at once. I hope to receive from you tomorrow or next day the other two which I am a long time waiting for. If you decide to come I advise you to learn a little Italian—enough to spare yourself disadvantages at first. I advise you also to come very well dressed as this is a ‘highly respectable’ position I offer you. And I advise you finally not to come through Paris but to come London–Hamburg–Vienna–Trieste or London–Boulogne–Bâle–Milan–Trieste as these routes are cheaper. The Hamburg route, however, is very long and the sea-trip might be unpleasant at this season. I hope from the fact of your telegram that I was somewhat misled about your spectral appearance, and urge you to answer this without delay. Jim",
