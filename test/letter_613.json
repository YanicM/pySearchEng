  "text": "Dear Mr Quinn: I cabled you a few days ago as follows: I presume you now have my letter. So far as I can learn from the English editor of it, the Little Review seems to have suspended publication. He knows nothing of any number later than the July-August and we are now almost in December. Apart from what I wrote already concerning the publication by Huebsch, I have two other things to add. The first is: proofs. I began Ulysses in 1914 and shall finish it, I suppose, in 1921. This is, I think, the twentieth address at which I have written it—and the coldest. The complete notes fill a small valise, but in the course of continual changings very often it was not possible to sort them for the final time before the publication of certain instalments. The insertions (chiefly verbal or phrases, rarely passages) must be put in for the book publication. Before leaving Trieste I did this sorting for all episodes up to and including Circe. The episodes which have the heaviest burden of addenda are Lotus-eaters, Lestrygonians, Nausikaa and Cyclops. Therefore I must stipulate to have three sendings of proofs (preferably a widemargined one must be pulled), namely: The second point is: that if Huebsch decides to print it and the copies are subscribed, an advance (and a substantial advance) of royalties be paid over by him at once. I hope to finish the Circe episode before Christmas. Eumeus, being already drafted, I could send on in January. The printing of the book could be put in hand at once when the contract is signed. I must have a few months’ leisure after January to write the Ithaca and Penelope episodes which, however, have been sketched since 1916 and are very short in comparison with the Circe episode. With kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
