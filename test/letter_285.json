  "text": "Dear Mr Mann First of all I must ask you to excuse me for not having answered before now your very kind letter. As you will see I have had some troubles which prevented me from doing so. Your setting of my song is the third I have heard. I find it very happy in tone and the sliding scale on the third line makes a very nice effect. I suppose if you set Lean out of the window it will be in the same vein. This vein is a little strange to me now as I wrote the verses six or seven years ago but I had it brought back to me very clearly when I heard your music. If it is sung perhaps you would let me know as I live rather far away and cannot follow the fate of the songs. It is very kind of you to inquire about what I am writing. I have published only Chamber Music but am just now engaged in correcting the proofs of a new book, a volume of stories, Dubliners which Messrs Maunsel & Co, Dublin, will bring out next month. If it should come your way I wonder whether it will please you: but it is not lyrical! I hope you will write to me and let me know if you set other songs in the book and, thanking you for your kindness and courtesy I am very sincerely yours James Joyce",
