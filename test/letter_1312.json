  "text": "Dear Mrs Colum: Thanks for your cable. By the next boat mail you will receive through my friend Léon a letter and a dozen or so prospectuses. Il s’agit d’un present and a surprise I am planning to make to Lucia for her next birthday 26 July. She is at present at the Maison de Santé Dr Delmas, 23 rue de la Mairie at Ivry, Paris. She has been extremely and even dangerously low since last Xmas but I am still hoping and working, almost alone now I am afraid. I know you will do what you can to give her the poor pleasure I intend. Giorgio was operated a week ago for his thyroid gland. The vocal chords seem to have been quite unaffected at any rate. He is making good progress and it is believed this will radically change his whole health. How are you both? We hope for the best and that we may soon see you over here in spite of the disturbed conditions now abroad in the world. It has been almost impossible for me to continue writing with such terrible anxiety night and day. Still I am doing what I can. Our kindest remembrances to you both in which Giorgio, Helen and Stevie join. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
