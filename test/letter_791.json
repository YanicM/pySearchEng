  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: For some days past I have not been allowed to read a line on account of a secretion in the conjunctiva—scarcely any inflammation, no pain and it seems no danger. Dr Borsch says I must limit my work in present conditions to a half or a third. I have been working ten hours a day in semi-dark for the past seven months. I am to be operated on when the fine weather comes I suppose in May. He says it will be much simpler and have a good result. I hope to resume with Shaun tomorrow. I had done about a third. But he (already a dawdler) will be longer on the road. I asked Miss Beach to send you the Transatlantic Review. You will notice revisions in it. I also send you an article by Mr Ford. Mr Gorman’s book on me arrived. It is well and carefully written but it reminds me of so much labour and strife that I am afraid it was in part responsible for a nervous collapse I had a few days ago. I went out today and feel better. I am glad you are going to rid yourself of the worry of the publishing business but, of course, mistrustful of your successor. Can you get Mr Gorman’s book in Brentano’s, London. I suppose so. This has been a dreadful winter and the prospect of ending it in a clinique is the only proper finale. But I hope there is something better beyond. Miss Beach will send your copy of Ulysses to London by some trustworthy messenger, if she has not done so. I have not seen her for a while as my general expression is not a pleasant one to offer to anybody’s gaze, though, strangely enough, the Shaun the Post piece is very amusing—to me, at least. It is extremely hard to write. I hope you are well after your stay in the country and that you will not be bored by this letter. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Job",
