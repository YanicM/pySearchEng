  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I agree to Mr Pound’s proposal regarding the deleted passages and thank you for your kind letter and your kind promise to read the proofs. Mr Pinker has sent me his agreement to sign. I am signing it so that if the trouble about the printing is ended there may be no more delay. As for your agreement you can sign it whenever you wish: or if another agreement is made or one with other clauses added I shall sign it also. I consider this matter of very little importance. I hope you will find a printer to do the book. It seems I am destined to meet always their opposition. I feel sure that you will do your best to bring out the book soon. I am so nervous about it that I cannot write any more but if it were published it would make my way clearer. Mr Pinker’s opinion that for this book the date of publication is unimportant is also mine. I may mention however that my book Dubliners was published on 15 June and my publisher chose that date. I am writing also to Mr Pound and to my agent and hope they may be able to help us. May I ask you to note my new address—as above? With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
