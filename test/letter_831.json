  "text": "Dear Mr Walsh, I am glad to hear that you are now in better health and hope the climate down there will do you good. Evidently you did not get a letter which my daughter, Lucia, sent you while I was in hospital to the Grand Hotel, Bayonne. In that letter she explained to you that I was in the hospital and that I could not publish anything in any review until a piece which I am sending to the Criterion, London, had first appeared, as I had promised Mr T.S. Eliot to give him the preference. When it appears (July next) I shall send you something and if you wish you may use my name as that of a future contributor. I am enclosing a typescript which a friend of mine sent to me in the hope that you may like it or at least get into communication with him. He was at one time art critic for the New York Herald here and he delivered a series of lectures in Dublin on modern French painters and also a lecture on Ulysses at Oxford. He is an Irishman and I think he may be of some use to you. I am answering the other part of your letter on a separate sheet as you may wish to print it. Many thanks for the kind expression contained in your letter. Please give our regards to Miss Moorhead and accept the same for yourself. Sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Unfortunately I have to return to the clinic in a week in order to undergo another but less serious operation, after which I hope I shall be able to work with more ease. At present I am unable to read or write.",
