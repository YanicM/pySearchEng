  "text": "Dear Stannie, Will you please send to Stuart Gilbert, 43 or 45 Avenue Pasteur, Becon-les-Bruyere, Paris, that German book if it is in Trieste, about Odysseus he wrote for. Also the partial score of Samuel Butler’s Ulysses, as he needs them both for his book. I return to the clinic with Nora on the fourth where she has to undergo another and larger operation which it is hoped and believed will effect a radical cure, especially after the former results of the former operation and radium treatment. My reading sight seems to have come to an end but I was informed that both eyes should be again operated. This will be operation nine and ten. Nevertheless with the help of about ten assistants I was able to check the next installment for Transition which comes out this week. Don’t allude to this news about Nora in any letter reaching me before the fifth proximo as she does not know it yet. Best wishes to Nellie and kind regards from us all. Jim",
