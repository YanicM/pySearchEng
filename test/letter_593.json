  "text": "Dear Miss Barney: As I hear that you are leaving town on the 9th for some time I shall deem it a great favour if you can let me know before you go whether there is any reply either from Mr Poe or from Mr Valette. I have a letter for the manager of the Vieux Columbier but do not wish to present it. The translator has finished the first chapter of my novel which is ready for publication in any review that will take it. With many thanks for your kind intervention Sincerely yours James Joyce",
