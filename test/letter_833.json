  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver Thanks for remembering me and in connection with St Patrick. I was able just to finish the revision of the piece for Mr Eliot but fear it would have to be copied out again as I doubt whether any typist would make it out. There was little or no improvement in the sight of the right eye until the last few days when fresh trouble broke out in it and the dental operation fixed for yesterday had to be put off again. The X-ray photograph showed what is called a sequester and this has to be removed but I do not know when nor does anybody else. I have now been put on a starvation diet by way of adding to my present pleasures. The weather here renders my cure almost impossible once an attack has set in. I am also advised to walk eight or ten kilometers a day. If I can do this with one eye sightless and the other inflamed in todayâ€™s thick damp fog through the traffic of Paris on an unfed stomach I shall apply for the legion of honor. I should like to hear Vico read to me again in the hope that some day I may be able to write again. I put an advertisement in the Mail for a reader but got not even one reply though I have often seen advertisements from Italians in it. I sent the disc to London by Mr McAlmon. If you have a gramophone you ought to get some discs of John MacCormack. I have some which are very good. I suppose you will soon be back in London. Give my best greetings to Miss Marsden. With kindest regards sincerely yours Lucia Joyce, James Joyce",
