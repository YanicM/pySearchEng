  "text": "Dear Mother I didn’t write before this as I was expecting the parcel which has not yet (Monday morning) arrived. I have sent in the review of that book to the Express so let Stannie look out for it. The name of the new paper is ‘Men and Women’ and the editor described it to me as something between the ‘Spectator’ and the ‘Tatler’ so if you buy these papers you can see for yourself. It will be a weekly, price sixpence. Tell Stannie to send me at once (so that I may have it by Thursday night) my copy of Wagner’s operas and if he can to enclose with it a copy of Grant Allen’s ‘Paris’. By the way at page 100 of ‘La Femme en Gris’ he will find a pawn-ticket for two books which must be seen to without delay. I am afraid I have let it lie too long. I hope Stannie is recovered by now and I hope you are doing what I told you. I met Archer at the Liberal Club but our talk though it lasted a long time was not very business-like. I also met Lady Gregory and had just time to see Mr O’Connell before I caught my train. The ‘Speaker’, I understand, though a good paper is a poor paper and so is the ‘Academy’ but perhaps I shall send them something. However I intend to explore among papers myself without any introduction. Don’t forget to urge on matters at home—I mean about Charlie’s preparing for that exam (sometime in the spring) and about Stannie. I hope you will write to me and if you do write also about the things that interest us. Tell Pappie I expect to hear how he is getting on with the ‘Irish Times’. Jim I delayed this letter till today (Tuesday) thinking there might be a letter in the parcel which would require an answer.",
