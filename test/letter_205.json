  "text": "Dear Mr Palmer: I received safely your other three songs for which I thank you very much and beg you kindly to excuse me for not writing sooner. However, I was rather busy with rehearsals of a concert at which I had to sing in the quintette from the Master Singers. Do you understand the infatuation of people for this opera? I think it is pretentious stuff. The second three songs please me better than the first five. The setting of the first is very delicate and the effect is finely sustained in the third. The rendering of ‘Play on, invisible harps &c’ follows the change of the verse splendidly. All the persons to whom I showed your music think it very distinguished. I am going to Ireland this week and shall try to bring your songs under the notice of someone in Dublin who may bring them out. If you should happen to be in Ireland during the month of August I should be glad to meet you. My address is: 44 Fontenoy Street, Dublin. There is no likelihood of my writing any more verse unless something unforeseen happens to my brain. I have written a book of stories called Dubliners and am in treaty with a publisher about it. Besides that I am at work on a novel A Portrait of the Artist at which I have been engaged now for six years. When (or rather if) either of these sees the light you may be sure I shall not fail to send you a copy of it. I hope you may set all of Chamber Music in time. This was indeed partly my idea in writing it. The book is in fact a suite of songs and if I were a musician I suppose I should have set them to music myself. The central song is XIV after which the movement is all downwards until XXXIV which is vitally the end of the book. XXXV and XXXVI are tailpieces just as I and III are preludes.",
