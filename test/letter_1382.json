  "text": "Dear Helen: I am glad to hear you are so far improved that you are going to the theatre as we see by your letter or rather Giorgio’s which also says you have booked on the Queen Mary. I shall arrange as you wish with the Turners. Apparently they are not to be back today as their concierge said since you give date of their arrival as 10 circ. Anyhow I’ll ring them up. By the same boat I had a long letter from David chiefly about Russian literature and his work. He wants to be a jazz critic, I gather. We went to Gurievich’s concert. It was in a small club hall, see enclosed. Paul Valery was to have spoken but someone of his family died and he sent a letter. Fernand Gregh the poet spoke. He was a friend of D’Annunzio’s and in fact I think L’Innocente is dedicated to him. There was quite a pleasant atmosphere. G. played very well but he then spoiled our hearing of the readings by walking about the hall. Not knowing it was he I told him over my shoulder in French to sit down in the name of God. He was quite unconscious. I didn’t see Zecchi there. Perhaps I found his address too late. We went with Nino Frank. The music of Pizzetti and Debussy was very charming. There was nothing political or fashionable about it but one came away with a pleasant taste in one’s ears. He wanted to do a Franz concert for May. In view of Giorgio’s statement that he needs to gargle a few weeks first I shall say nothing encouraging and leave the whole thing in the air till you arrive. I really know nothing about Mrs K-F except the two versions of her children’s death (neither of which seems to trouble her overmuch) and the fact that she asked the pleasure of our company at dinner, which I could hardly get out of being there in Lausanne. I will not say anything to anybody about the letter you mention. It is rather curious that the two men in whom poor Lucia tried to see whatever she or any other woman or girl is looking for should now be going around with two sisters. After having got up, each of them, from a hospital bed. And that I should have gone from one bed to the other. Tonight we are to dine at the Gormans as it is her birthday and she told me Beckett and Miss Curran are to be there. The Gorman child scalded all the skin off both her legs and was in bed a month. I have not seen Beckett for some weeks. I have had no time to see anybody as I had a lot of interviewing and telephoning to do about this new doctor’s idea. The Turners or Returners will be back at 10 p m but can’t meet them as we are going out to dine. So sent them flowers. All right. We won’t go to Cherbourg. Instead I am chartering an aeroplane and will meet you and escort you on from the Azores. Keep a good look out for me, Stevie, up in the air. The name of the plane is Dedalus 56 Tante belle cose a tutti Babbo",
