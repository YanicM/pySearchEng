  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Will you please add in whatever you have on your copy of t.12 on the copy sent you on Thursday and tear out the pages and send them back. I am working desperately hard for t.13 as the final revision of U took a dreadful lot of time. I have received two more offers from U.S.A. each of $11,000 in advance of 20% royalties. Not bad for a book which a year ago they called gibberish, t.13 contains an article by Budgen (very good) and one by Gilbert. Terrible storms here. I think you will like Yb when you see him in full dress. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
