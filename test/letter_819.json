  "text": "Dear Larbaud: Thanks for the typescript. It almost finishes the question but there are just two points I would like to discuss. Can Mrs Nebbia and yourself come here and have tea on Friday 29 at 4.30. We could discuss it then. Morel has done, it seems, 100 pages of Ulysse. I shall look up this matter of the German rights before you come. I am not free till the 28 as on the 27 I have to read part of the Sirens for a gramophone record. There is bad news too. I have cataract. The doctor did not tell me till a few days ago. I am to be operated on the 31. Et jâ€™en ai marre! Kind regards from us to Mrs Nebbia and yourself Sincerely yours James Joyce",
