  "text": "Dear Miss Beach: Page 5 last line is VENERSDERG the rest is right. I wish Walsh would stay in one place till I have corrected the proofs. How will you manage to send U from the desert? My sight is queer but not bad. I return your letters under separate cover as the envelope is too small. I suppose the International Blue Book is worth subscribing to on account of the colour. The spaces could be filled in exactly from Who’s Who. My full name is James (Augustine Aloysius) Joyce. The address 12 rue de l’Odéon as I do not want importunate visitors. Does Ulysses VI (it’s like the name of a pope) come out on Saturday? I suppose you will hand over the fact to your press agents. I am much impressed by Anna Sequana here. I suppose you did not get a copy of the York, Towneley and Chester Mystery plays for me? I have some of them somewhere. I cannot remember the absurd names given to Mrs Noah (who is as quaint as U) in them. But no matter. My bachelor brother in Trieste is engaged to be married. If cheques arrive for me there (Criterion or Quarter) will you please instruct Miss Moschos about them. The possession of cash makes all the difference in the world to hotelkeepers.",
