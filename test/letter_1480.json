  "text": "Dear Gunn: It was very kind of Mrs Gunn and yourself to have brought that parcel to Lucia. She wrote me the other day and told me about it. I enclose a cheque (150 frs) and shall be grateful if you can send her something for Easter with the odd 50 francs, I mean apart from the 100 frs I already owe. What she likes best is fruit (not sweets) and gingerbread. We ought to send an egg but the eggs are always filled with sweets. We shall not be there for Easter…. I expect my son here tomorrow and I fear for many reasons that we shall be obliged to transfer Lucia to a maison departmentale at Moulins. It will be near us here but a great change for her. Those people with whom she has been for nearly five years of her eight years’ illness are quite kind to her and understand her. Is Dr O’Brien now there? If he is perhaps he could run out and see her once. He knows her and Dr Delmas already and Lucia would be glad to see him. Remember me to him anyway. Thanks also for the cutting about Gorman’s book. I should like to read the other you speak of. No, I do not receive notices from the U.S. and I think I told you, I actually had to buy the copy of my biography which I possess. So if you don’t want it yourself, please let me see the other critique. As soon as I have come to some decision I shall let you know. I shall of course write to my daughter for Easter. I have already tried to explain to her something of the whole lamentable affair. I’m afraid the outlook is very bad. I hope Mrs Gunn and yourself and the aforesaid good doctor and all the Rockefellerians and will pass a pleasant and convivial Eastertide by the silver sea.",
