  "text": "Dear Pound: I went to the station this morning to start at 7:30. On my arrival there I was told that a passenger train which had left some hours before had collided with another, result as per enclosed cutting. Luckily I was not on it. I was also told that the 7:30 express Trieste–Paris is now off owing to strike. There are two trains between T and Desenzano, viz: one at 11:30 a.m. reaching there about the witching hour of midnight. The other at 5, travelling (or crawling) all night and reaching there about 6 next morning. This train is impossible for me. Now it is my intention to travel over that line en route for England and Ireland as soon as possible but I think it is unprofitable to go now. I suppose after 12, June you will go to London. In that case we shall meet then, I hope. My only reason for accepting your kind invitation to Sirmione was to meet you. But still it would be a big expense for you. And also for me if I travelled secondclass. You may judge of the state of the railway here by second cutting. My reasons for travelling north are these. I am in need of a long holiday (by this I don’t mean abandonment of Ulysses but quiet in which to finish it) away from here. Without saying anything about this city (de mortuis nil nisi bonum) my own position for the past seven months has been very unpleasant. I live in a flat with eleven other people and have had great difficulty in securing time and peace enough to write those two chapters. The second reason is: clothes. I have none and can’t buy any. The other members of the family are still provided with decent clothes bought in Switzerland. I wear my son’s boots (which are two sizes too large) and his castoff suit which is too narrow in the shoulders, other articles belong or belonged to my brother and to my brother-in-law. I shall not be able to buy anything here. A suit of clothes, they tell me, costs 600–800 francs. A shirt costs 35 francs. I can just live with what I have but no more. Since I came here I suppose I have not exchanged 100 words with anybody. I spend the greater part of my time sprawled across two beds surrounded by mountains of notes. I leave the house at 12:22 and walk the same distance along the same streets buy the Daily Mail which my brother and wife read and return. Idem in the evening. I was once inveigled into a theatre. I was once invited to a public dinner, as professor of the Scuola Superiore here, and next day received from there a request to subscribe 20,000 or 10,000 or even 5000 lire of Italian war loan. I must buy clothes so I think I ought to go to Dublin to buy them. Thirdly, my two children have not slept in a bed since we came. They repose on hard sofas and the climate here is very trying in July–September. Fourthly, the rate of exchange is readjusting itself. While the pound (I mean the other pound, the English not the American one) stood at 100 or 90 I could fight the prices here because my money was in English currency. Today the pound is at 62 and my brother-in-law (who is cashier of a bank here) says it is gravitating towards a lower price owing to certain trade manoeuvres or nobody could buy at such high figures. If it reaches 501 cannot swim any more but disappear under the surface. If I went to Switzerland I could not keep myself or family there: besides I dislike returning to places. Prices here are from 8 to 10 times what they were in 1914. I could give lessons here (most people expected it of me) but I will not. I have a position in that school which the government has now raised to the rank of a university. My pay is about 3/– an hour for 6 hours a week. This I shall resign as it wastes my time and my nerves. I cannot find a flat here. To find one you must hold in the right hand a check for 20,000 or 30,000 lire as keymoney. So I propose to pass three months in Ireland in order to write Circe and the close of the book. I should return here with my family in October (if anyone finds a flat for us in the meantime) or, if not, without them in order to write the end of it. Financially my position is that I shall receive on 25 June (£62–10–0) and if my New York publisher advances (£25). I presume that by the time this £87 is finished I shall [be] within measurable distance of 25 September when I get another £62–10–0. My wife and children could stay in Galway. I too there or in Dublin. The disturbed state of Ireland is of course a reason for not going. There may be other reasons. But I could not go to an English seaside town as it would be too dear. If I manage to do this and if you are in London at the end of June there are, I suppose, several things I could do such as seeing my agent. What do you think of this plan? I must finish my book in quiet even if I sell off the furniture I have here. I hope you received safely The Oxen of the Sun and have sent it off to London and New York. I was bringing down another copy this morning. The worst of it is I fear that Linati may come down on you. I wrote him yesterday express that I should be in Sirmione tonight and mentioned your suggestion of our meeting! Have you seen Poesia or shall I send it? I hope Mrs Pound is still well. It is a pity that I cannot see my wav to go now but perhaps it is better so if I can manage the other and in that case we can meet more comfortably. Let me know as soon as possible about the safe arrival of chapter. With many regrets and regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. This is a very poetical epistle. Do not imagine that it is a subtlv worded request for secondhand clothing. It should be read in the evening when the lakewater is lapping and very rhythmically.",
