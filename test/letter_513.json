  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I ought to apologise for my impossible health which so often obliges me to appear discourteous. I enclose some notices of my play Exiles of which you were so good as to write favourably. I appreciate very much your friendly words about the Scylla-Charybdis episode of my book Ulysses but am sorry that it deprived you of sleep. On most other readers I daresay it will have the opposite effect. I sent some days ago the episode Wandering Rocks to Mr Pound who is ill also. If he has not sent it to you could you write to him. As soon as I am able to work again I shall finish the Sirens and send it. I am much better this evening but my eyes are so capricious that I may be ill tomorrow. This time the attack was in my ‘good?’ eye so that the decisive symptoms of iritis never really set in. It has been light but intermittent so that for five weeks I could do little or nothing except lie constantly near a stove like a chimpanzee whom in many things I resemble. I received a copy of The Egoist with the second episode. I hope I shall be able to finish the book this year or early next year. It is as difficult for me to write it as for my readers to read it. I asked Mr Chalas to convey my thanks to Mr Aldington and would ask you to convey my excuses to Mr Lewis. Two notices of his book Tarr were promised me but neither has appeared. As soon as I begin to go about I shall try to push the matter. One was sent to a Dutch review eighteen months ago and published last week! Mr Linati wrote to me during my illness and I shall write to him if the Italo-Swiss frontier is open now. I must not omit to thank you for your prompt remittance of royalties in December. It was very useful to me. I hope that wretched book some day will repay you even in part for all the trouble it has caused you. With renewed thanks and kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
