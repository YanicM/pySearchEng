  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards, I have been waiting all the week for a letter from you with regard to my book. The month of September is now nearly over and I am still uncertain of its fate. I write to you now because I wish that this suspense of mind in which I live at present may come to an end one way or the other. I need scarcely assure you how disheartening it is for me to see (as I see) that yet another season is going by without my book being published. And I think you will not accuse me of being importunate if I ask you to write me definitely on receipt of this letter. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
