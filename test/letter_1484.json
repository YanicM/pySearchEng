  "text": "Dear Mrs Sax: If you have returned from San Remo to San Romolo there is something you could do for me. The name of the review which published my fragmentary translation of Anna Livia is Prospettive, the editor is Curzio Malaparte, the date is 15 February and the price is 3 lire. I have no copy myself as I gave mine away I cannot find a copy in the only two Italian bookshops I know in Paris. So if you could get through a bookshop a copy of the 15th February and also of the 15 March and send them to me I should be glad. If you tell me of some book you may want from here I would send it in exchange as one cannot easily send money. The news about your sister does not seem too bad. The two cases in our family continue with everything else to make our outlook anything but cheerful. We are glad to hear you are both well. Please send the review to me at my former address: Hotel de la Paix S Gerand-Le Puy/Allier. Kind remembrances to you both from us both J.J.",
