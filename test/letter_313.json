  "text": "My dearest I called this morning to see Roberts by appointment. He was not there but left the enclosed letter for me. I read it and walked down the street feeling the whole future of my life slipping out of my grasp. I remained sitting for an hour on a sofa in my father’s office. All last night I had gone over the whole book in my mind, imagined that I saw it, that those whom I know were reading it, imagined the reviews of it, friendly and unfriendly. This morning everything seemed to collapse. It seems to me I had best say nothing more. For a long time today I thought of spending the last money I have on a revolver and using it on the scoundrels who have tortured my mind with false hopes for so many years. I will say no more. If you love me you will feel for you [sic], I am sure, dear, that you do—and O how I should like to have your sympathy and words of encouragement, to forget all and fall asleep in your arms hidden by your love. I don’t know what I will do or can do. I will think. I will fight to the last. Stannie has not sent me a line or any money. Tomorrow I must pawn my watch and chain in order to remain on a little longer. Everything seems to have melted away from me, money, hope and youth. You at least will remain. Don’t grieve for me. Eat and sleep and be happy. When we meet (and I hope it will be very soon) I hope to find in you what I have lost elsewhere, to see you young and happy and smiling and walking like a queen. Jim P.S. I was surprised and disappointed not to have had a letter from you today. Write at once and send me back by return Roberts’s letter. Think of me—but do not vex yourself. Jim",
