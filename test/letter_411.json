  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Thanks for your letter of 23 ult. I enclose agreement signed and initialled. Miss Weaver writes that seven printers have refused to set up the book and for this reason she prefers not to sign a contract. Mr Pound suggests that blank spaces be left by the printers and that the deleted passages be pasted in at the publishing offices, typewritten and on good paper. I agree to this or to any scheme by which the book shall be published as I wrote it and as quickly as possible. Miss Weaver is kind enough to say that she will read the proofs herself. This will also save time. Some person in her employment told her the book should appear before 1 April. She writes that this is not your opinion. It is also not mine. My book Dubliners was published on 15 June. I shall be anxious to hear whether the English Review has accepted the verses or not. Mr Pound wrote also that some friend of Mr Barker (Mr Wheelan?) spoke of producing my play Exiles. Is it possible to offer it in that quarter?",
