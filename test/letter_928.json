  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have no news yet about the MS but I hope you got it. I got your letter with your guess at Ibsen’s (the Swedish writer as Lewis carelessly calls him) lines. Archer’s literal translation was, I think: the racier version, more in the lilt, would be As regards the title, ‘one squared’ can be used in the ‘math’ lesson by the writer of Part II if he, she or it is so ‘dispoged’. The title I projected is much more commonplace and accords with the J J & S and A.G.S. & Co sign and it ought to be fairly plain from a reading of K. The sign in this form means H C E interred in the landscape. It is rather singular hat for the last three years I have been carrying three photographs of Tuohy’s portraits in my pocket—those of my father, myself and James Stephens. The combination of his name from that of mine and my hero in A.P.O.T.A.A.Y.M. is strange enough. I discovered yesterday, through enquiries made in Paris, that he was born in Dublin on the 2 February 1882. As regards K it seems to be rolling round the globe over all kinds of toes. A Boston University professor (?) criticising it says it was just turned off unconsciously in an idle half-hour. Dr Henry Seidl Canby (?) in a long review for the American equivalent of the Speaker (??) begins: Ulysses was a night book but this seems to be a day book with the rivers of Ireland for chief characters. A writer in a review of it in Laurens County, Georgia, says: We and the Oconee river of all places in the world are in it too. Why, Mr J. and his God alone know! Another writer: ‘He has determined to write as a lunatic for lunatics’. A young man called on me before I left Paris, knew a lot of it by heart, recites it to his friends and was very enthusiastic. I found that he did not understand many of the words. Another (or rather many) says he is imitating Lewis Carroll. I never read him till Mrs Nutting gave me a book, not Alice, a few weeks ago—though, of course, I heard bits and scraps. But then I never read Rabelais either though nobody will believe this. I will read them both when I get back. I read a few chapters of a book called La langue de Rabelais. I have little inclination at present either to read or write. The last five years with three violent eye attacks, seven operations—the last particularly bad—nine editions of Ulysses, the piracy, protest, lawsuit and Pen dinner with its sequel and the French and German translations are quite enough to say nothing of the completion of Pts I & III amid all sorts of changing domiciles etc. I have asked Miss Beach to circulate transition among such people as professor Faÿ, Cazamian etc and I will try to think out some other plans—not for further writing, however. I have tried to keep off the stage as much as possible in the interest of other people’s finer feelings but evidently it is not enough. I hope the publication of P.P. (proofs of which are now revised) will be understood as my candidature for a post of minor poet. It will afford a good occasion for several who are that way inclined to let off their batteries against me. They can blow it to pieces. That will relieve them and do me no harm. Though if I may parody R.L.S. who, as you may know, was my stylemaster along with Little Lord Fauntleroy and Mr and Mrs Henry Wood: As their heads are so full of a number of things I am sure they should all be as happy as kings! Here is the news. Mr Roth has published a letter in which he states on the authority of Dr Joseph Collins that I am really a jew. Mr Roth is up for preliminary examination today 31 floreal in New York City. Mr Lindbergh, a Norwegian Swedoyank, has arrived in Paris. Mr Lewis has also arrived in Paris and wants to hear Mr Antheil’s music if he can get to Mr Antheil’s room…. Miss Morehead has been boxing a round with Mr Pound. Mr Joyce, author of “‘Perce Oreille’” and other lyrics, was savagely attacked by a mongrel on the beach at Scheveningen on last Wednesday. I never got such a fright in my life, says poor blind Joyce. My glasses got broken and the dog’s master and mistress had a full quarter of an hour’s work to beat the animal off. His master repeatedly got him down and hit his head but the animal, pretending to give in, slunk around and made for me again. My wife and Lucia had gone to have tea and I was lying on my overcoat reading the guidebook and trying to make out where the Hook of Holland was when he rushed at me. His master and I spent a chatty time afterwards groping on our knees in the sand for the debris of my glasses—now restored. It is a majestic beach indeed. A very restful country too, it seems. The cuisine is funny, ginger with breakfast, cinnamon in the beans, nutmeg in the spinach, pickled cucumbers on sale on the strand, and allspice in everything. Very civil people too. Do you know Johannes Vermeer’s View of Delft?",
