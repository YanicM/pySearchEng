  "text": "Dear Stannie: Have you written to me? I got no letter. Don’t write 5, I on address as some letters went astray. Simply 5. Concierges in Paris deliver all letters within the house. What in hell’s name am I to do about my case of books? Did anybody go or phone there. Please let me hear by return. Curse their bloody bumbling bawling lousy good for nothing blatant souls! I expected they would do what they could to upset me and any plans I had. Have written Circe about five times. It allows me about four or five hours sleep every night. The case of books was fetched on 30 June. It was marked J.J. 38, weighed about 40–50 chilos. Sender: Bruna⁠[,] Adriatica, Piazza della Piave. Miss Weaver writes that she would prefer, instead of making over the £2000 to me in the form of War Loans, to pass me the money direct so that I may apply it if and as I think fit (the capital, i.e., or part of it) during ‘my best, most creative years’. So that I expect we will open a credit in some bank for the amount in my name. More anon. The M.S. I sent to Quinn from Trieste on 10 June never reached him (by his letter of 17 August) while that sent from Paris 6 weeks later did. Isn’t that enough to drive anyone wild! He sent however 3500 francs on the second batch, and will send more if other parcel arrives. I suppose I have to write it out all over again! Curse them again! He will give 20,000 lire for the entire MS of Ulysses but wants the end of it and the corrected proofs. A scheme is proposed for a separate special edition of U. to be printed (1000 copies) here for U.K. and U.S.A. at 200 lire a copy by which I am calculated to get about 80,000 independent of the other ordinary edition. I foresee that my Triestine friends will buy up all this edition. Giorgio has been offered a position at 500 fs (French) a month in the office of an Indian merchant here (similar to Ralli Bros). I give him coaching every night in English, French, German and Italian correspondence—all jumbled together—as I asked the principal to keep the job open for 3 weeks. I hope he is not overestimating my son’s abilities. This is not the other post I wrote of. In any case if he likes it it would be a good opening as this is their first European branch and he would have to travel with the principal in Spain Italy and Germany. I enclose a few cuttings from Irish papers. With most of your remarks I agree. Please contradict the following reports at present in circulation about me whenever they present themselves. That I was sent to Ireland 8 years ago by the Austrian F.O. (report of Maunsel and Co) That I made money during the war as a Brit. gov. spy (report of friends and relatives in Dublin) That Ulysses was a prearranged pro-German code (report of Brit, war censor subsequently scouted by literary experts! This came to light last week) That I was a Sinn Fein emissary in Switzerland and the English Players a blind (report of one of the English actors of my company, paid by me) That I am addicted to cocaine, morphia etc (report of Triestines) That I founded in Zurich the dadaist movement which is now exciting Paris (report of Irish press last week) That I am a violent bolshevik propagandist (report of yourself for purposes of discussion) That I am the cavalier servente of the Duch— of M—, Mme M— R— M—.; a prince— de X—, Mrs T–n–t A— and the Dowager Empress of Ch–na. Write about those books please Jim P.S. I see Trieste is in riot. Keep out of the way of both their lousy projectiles. I enclose 3 stamps I found [in] my purse",
