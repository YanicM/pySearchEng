I hope you received the initials from Herbert Hughes and also the 3 poems my son took the printer’s yesterday. I enclose a galley page of the Oxford University Press edition of Pomes Penyeach which you may be interested to see—Colum’s preface. Will you be so good as to return it to me? Sincerely yours James Joyce Tel. Auteuil 17.28",
