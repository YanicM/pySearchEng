  "text": "Dear Larbaud: My son is now married as perhaps you know and my flat has become too noisy of late years so I have given it up, stored my things and am leaving Paris till late in the autumn when I shall come back and rent a much smaller one. I hope you are better by now and that it may be possible for us to meet (if not to dine though purtroppo I too am on a regime after [a] miniature collapse) before [I] leave in the next few days. Kindest remembrances to Mrs Larbaud and yourself from us both James Joyce P.S. I have quite a different opinion about the Svevo preface.",
