  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: We returned here a couple of days ago. Another mountain came to Muhammadâ€”my brother from Dublin whom I had not seen for twelve years. He went away last night. Strange to say like Shaun his work is postal night duty. I had an interesting conversation with Mr Morel in Carnac and Vannes. I suppose you received Commerce. I arrived here to find a first class battle in progress between one of the editors Mr Fargue and princess Somebody on the one hand and Miss Beach and Miss Monnier on the other. Thank goodness I am out of it. Mr Larbaud is here but I have not seen him yet. I know his first words will be: have you something to read to me? No. O! My sister-in-law is a devotee of S. Patrick and keeps his statue on her mantelpiece. She gave me a pocket breast-plate in the new Irish colours with part of his famous prayer on it cut in the form of a shield. At the top is a cross and at the end are the words: all rights reserved. This must be the first case of copyright in the history of humanity. I hope that in a day or two I shall have fixed up something about a flat so that we can leave for London. During these last two days the sight of my eye has been wretched. I see less than before. It is very irritating. I cannot understand why part of this deposit cannot be removed when they can remove everything else in the eye. I shall try to see the doctor tomorrow or Tuesday. The fourth edition of Ulysses is sold out. The fifth will appear at the end of the month. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
