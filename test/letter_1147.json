  "text": "Dear Budgen: I thank Mrs Budgen and yourself and the Suters for your message but never believe anything an Englishman tells you in the press or an Irishman in a bar about me. I was not operated: after 5 weeks study of the case Vogt decided it was too difficult and dangerous even for him. But I have to go back to Z’ch every 10 or 12 weeks for a year or a year and a half as he is observing some process and will not trust any other doctor. Damn well right too. I wish I had met him ten years ago. And talking of press reports I got a pile of clippings a few days ago about a reading of A.L.P. by Miss Allgood to be given in a London theatre. I heard nothing about it. A few vague words with her some 15 months ago. And of an Irish academy of letters including myself. As for that I had a letter from Yeats and Shaw but declined to send in my name. I wish you and Sargent could see Lucia’s book of lettrines at Harmsworth’s shop. Please go with him and if you like them as I know you will a line would please her greatly. The enclosed is a little silly but rather graceful—I mean the picture of myself and daughter and of Wilhelm Meister. There is something Mignonesque about her and, if it comes to that, I do not mind being called a ‘harmonieux vieillard’ when there are so many inharmonious young striplings about. Here (if I can find it) is a letter I had from Jung. But please send it and the cutting back bei Gelegenheit, The letter of course is privileged. Have not replied yet. How about your book? Is it ‘marching’? If I can throw any obscurity on the subject let me know. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
