  "text": "Dear McAlmon: Many thanks for that most opportune cheque for which I enclose I.O.U. Lord knows what I should have done without it after the expenses of removal. O Herr Gott in Himmel was ist das für ein Hundesleben! I am getting through your proofs. The stories remind me in a way of Dubliners—not in treatment or the characters—rather the mental predisposition. Are you going to publish it through Shakespeare and Co or on your own? Darantière is damn slow setting Penelope. I wanted to send it to you before but can’t get it out of him. Larbaud wants it too. In a few days I hope. Have sent the first part of Ithaca to the typist and am working like a lunatic, trying to revise and improve and connect and continue and create all at the one time. I enclose a copy of a letter from Shaw which, though it is dated 11/6/921 I saw for the first time an hour or so ago. As it is a private letter no use should be made of it in print, I suppose. Still I think it ought to be made known otherwise. I think I can read clearly (with the one good eye I have) between the lines. I would also take on a small bet (up to 4.75 francs) that the writer has subscribed anonymously for a copy of Ulysses through some bookseller. With many thanks again and wishes for your magnolious expansiveness.",
