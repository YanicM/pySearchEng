My book—on which I am working all day and all night as well—is to be published by Faber and Faber (London) and the Viking Press (New York). I am glad to know you are safe and well. Glad also to be able to tell in an anniversary message that last evening my friend in the French F.O. rang up to say that permission for H. Broch to enter France had been telegraphed to the French C.G. in Vienna. I am trying to get two other people into America and hope I shall succeed. With best wishes to Mrs Brody and yourself sincerely yours James Joyce",
