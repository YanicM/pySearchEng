  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am very glad to receive your letter of 19 instant and to hear that the novel is at last about to be published. I hope that Mr Huebsch has my corrections. I have had no letter from him nor have I signed a contract with him nor has my agent written to me on this matter for several months past. But since you speak of writing for copies I suppose that the book is in course of printing. I am sure you are rather tired of the whole business though I am quite accustomed to it: after eleven years ci ho fatto il callo. I hope that the sales will repay you in some measure and I shall try to do something to that end. Allow me in conclusion to send you my thanks for all your kindness Sincerely yours James Joyce",
