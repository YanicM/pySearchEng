  "text": "My dearest Nora I send you by this post registered, express and insured a Christmas present. It is the best thing (but very poor after all) that I am able to offer you in return for your sincere and true and faithful love. I have thought every detail of it when lying awake at night or racing on cars around Dublin and I think it has come out nice in the end. But even if it brought only one quick flush of pleasure to your cheek when you first see it or made your true tender loving heart give one quick bound of joy I would feel well, well, well repaid for my pains. Perhaps this book I send you now will outlive both you and me. Perhaps the fingers of some young man or young girl (our childrenâ€™s children) may turn over its parchment leaves reverently when the two lovers whose initials are interlaced on the cover have long vanished from the earth. Nothing will remain then, dearest, of our poor human passion-driven bodies and who can say where the souls that looked on each other through their eyes will then be. I would pray that my soul be scattered in the wind if God would but let me blow softly for ever about one strange lonely dark-blue rain-drenched flower in a wild hedge at Aughrim or Oranmore. Jim",
