  "text": "Dearest Your telegram lay on my heart that night. When I wrote you those last letters I was in utter despair. I thought I had lost your love and esteem—as I well deserved to do. Your letter to me this morning is very kind but I am waiting for the letter you probably wrote after sending the telegram. I hardly dare to be anyway familiar with you yet, dear, until you give me leave again. I feel I ought not to, though your letter is written in your old familiar roguish way. I mean, when you say what you will do to me if I disobey you in a certain matter. I will venture to say just one thing. You say you want my sister to bring you across some underlinen. Please don’t, dear. I don’t like anyone, even a woman or a girl, to see things belonging to you. I wish you were more particular in leaving certain clothes of yours about, I mean, when they have come from the wash. O, I wish that you kept all those things secret, secret, secret. I wish you had a great store of all kinds of underclothes, in all delicate shades, stored away in a great perfumed press. How wretched it is to be away from you! Have you taken your poor lover to your heart again? I shall long for your letter and yet I thank you for your kind good telegram. Do not ask me to write a long letter now, dearest. What I have written above has saddened me a little. I am tired of sending words to you. Our lips together, our arms interwoven, our eyes swooning in the sad joy of possession, would please me more. Pardon me, dearest. I intended to be more reserved. Yet I must long and long and long for you. Jim",
