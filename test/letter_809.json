  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I did not wish to be the sender of bad news but a few days after my last letter to you the Paris papers announced the death of John Quinn. I sent a cablegram to his relatives (he once mentioned an uncle—a priest, I think). I did not see any notice of him except a short paragraph in the Irish Statesman. Mr Ford wrote to me that he had been incapable of attending to any business for several months and that this explains his attitude towards the Transatlantic Review which he was supposed to have founded and towards the Ulysses MS. I thought the dispersal of his huge library very strange. The catalogues were made out with immense carefulness and impartiality (many of the books uncut). It seemed to me a lamentable affair in every way and, so far as I am concerned, it did me a fair amount of harm with a public which values people by sales. If his judgment had grown weak I hope it was due to business worries rather than to suffering. He was a man who would have hidden both. Nobody understands why he wanted to sell the MS of Ulysses especially since he had made a sensational sale of another writer’s MSS—Joseph Conrad who has just died also. He had it complete for less than two years. I offered to read to him parts of the book I am writing as I did not want him to think that my unenthusiastic silence about the (then) proposed sale meant a want of appreciation for many things he had done for the book. He said he had no time but that he hoped to come over this summer. I could not understand what his attitude was. He talked to me about some wonderful works he had visited in Germany. I forget what they were for as I scarcely heeded his words—taking nitrate out of the air or something of the sort. Then he stopped the car and went into the French Foreign Office. I was greatly shocked to hear of his death as he had many good qualities. For the last ten days I have been proofreading—the revise of A Portrait of the Artist for Mr Cape. Thank goodness it went off today! Now I receive word that the Italian military authorities have called George Joyce to arms. Born in Austria, now Italy, of British subjects, now Irish Free State citizens or not, and resident in France he has a choice of armies. I have been to the vice-consul here … but as my experience of Italian government ways is not encouraging I prefer to have this important matter settled at the consulate in Paris. Can you call at the Freeman’s Journal or Irish Times office in London and get a copy of their paper for Monday 11 August? You will find in it (if they did not suppress it) a rather startling reference to me made by Mr Yeats in crowning with bay the spiritual victors of the Irish Olympic games. I presume as the conferring took place at the Royal Irish Academy that the members of the committee who negatived his proposal were present in full force. (In this connection you may refer to the closing paragraph of the Shem the Penman piece beginning Pariah … and ending … Anna Livia.) I am sorry my cyclopeyed face has that worried look. Really I have got some rest and a good deal of sea air. But it is true that I have been thinking and thinking how and how and how can I and can it—all about the fusion of two parts of the book—while my one bedazzled eye searched the sea like Cain—Shem—Tristan—Patrick from his lighthouse in Boulogne. I hope the solution will presently appear. At least I have never found anything in any other way than sitting with my mouth open picturesquely. We leave for Quimper—Hôtel de l’Epée—on Monday. After a short stay there I have to go to Paris to see Dr Borsch, my Trieste brother (who may also bring some brown turf), possibly my Dublin brother who has lately remarried and has some relatives-in-law in this country and also to see the H.B.M. and R.I. consuls-general. It is a miserable day. I wish Mr Pluvius had kept this day till my arrival in London. I have goloshes, a tarpaulin raincoat, a hood, an umbrella and a pair of yellow spectacles—so won’t the Londoners, standing beside the park wall out of the shower’s way, be delighted to see me groping by!",
