  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: To continue and conclude…. My father sent me a message by a friend in the curious roundabout delicate and allusive way he had in spite of all his loud elaborate curses (he is quoted on the jacket of an amusing book Lars Porsena or The Future of Swearing) that if I thought fit he would like a tombstone to be placed on his grave bearing the names of himself and my mother. He left the wording to me and did not mention his two sons, daughter and mother also buried there. Poor foolish man! It seems to me his voice has somehow got into my body or throat. Lately, more than ever—especially when I sigh. Jolas sends good news from Feldkirch but I never know whether these letters are rigged or not. Lucia writes announcing her arrival with the nurse on Friday next. I hope she does not decide to stay. I wish she would not come. She runs the risk of two more station scenes. I thought if she sent three letters GBS to Shaw on the 26th (they have the same birthday) he might like her talent. But I am afraid Shaw has lived too long on the boreal side of La Manche to appreciate silly things like that. Perhaps he is right too. I have had no reply from F and F. No doubt they will have several bored meetings of all the bored members. The reason Goll’s article is so rubbishy is not because Goll is not a poet of sorts. Tuohy’s portrait is a failure. Colum’s article is also. So is Lewis’s personal one (though his hostile criticism is by far the best that has appeared). And as for Pound’s pen pictures—heaven preserve us! Es tut mir leid aber es ist nichts zu malen. I cannot get a reply out of Collinson. … With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
