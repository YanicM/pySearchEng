  "text": "Dear Stannie, My solicitor will send you a cheque for 10£ on the 25 instant. I am sorry to hear you are pressed for money. How do you manage it? Living in a furnished apartment without a family, of exemplary habits and giving all the lessons to all the pupils. My case is different. Except for the four months I lived in Larbaud’s flat and the first six weeks I pay between 2500 and 3000 lire a month rent. The last six months’ work on Ulysses I did in this bedroom where three of us sleep without a desk, without books, etc. I did not receive the copy you promised of Joyce Spogliato in Casa. I am sure it was very funny and quite suited to the distinguished audience. Miss Weaver has made me another gift of £1500 in addition to the £2000 and the previous £5000 making £8500 in all, as well as the reversion of a country house somewhere. Nobody of my admirers in Trieste subscribed for Ulysses, except Baron Ralli. The first English notice appeared last week, and the day after 148 copies were ordered. The edition, 750 copies, at 150 francs, is out of print since Wednesday last. There remain only 50 copies of the de luxe and about 80 of the 250 franc, so the bowsies had better hurry up. I have now to arrange for the private English and American editions, out of which I expect to make as much again. The Paris edition brings me 82,000 net. It is a pity the fisarmonici did not know these funny details, or perhaps it is just as well. They might have laughed themselves to death. I was entertained to lunch last Friday by the British and Irish press of Paris, Admiral Sir Heaten Ellis in the chair. The Dail Eirann Minister of Publicity called on me and asked me if I intended to return to Ireland at present. I told him not for the present. One redeemed city (and inhabitants thereof) will last me for a few years more. He has proposed a resolution to his Irish cabinet to send my name to Stockholm as candidate for the Nobel prize. He will probably lose his portfolio without obtaining the prize for me. I have to remain here sometime yet to sign the last of the de luxe copies and to arrange with the publishers of the English and American editions and to have some of the chief errors and omissions rectified on the plates. After that I must get a holiday somewhere for a few months. As soon as money and time allow me to settle down I shall visit your hospitable city to collect a few odds and ends: pardon, to make a bundle of several things I could not put into my trunk on the occasion of my departure from Trieste. Nora has quite recovered from the shock—it was hardly an accident [typescript breaks off]",
