  "text": "Dear Everybody, Mr Yeats went to see the editor of ‘The Speaker’ in London but he was ill and I expect a letter every day: he is also to go to the editor of the ‘Academy’. He wrote to Miss Gonne, a letter of whose I enclose. He also introduced me to Arthur Symons and wants me to review for the Speaker a book of Symons’s—a translation of Francesca da Rimini. I breakfasted, lunched and dined with him and he paid all the hansoms and busses. I sent in my reviews to the ‘Express’ a day or two ago, so look out in the Express at the beginning of the week. I have certain definite information about the medical course. The first thing is to have a French baccalauréat but those who have foreign degrees may be dispensed therefrom by the Minister of Public Instruction. I have written to the Minister and this morning called at the Ministry and was told there that the dispensation would probably be accorded me in a few days. Thereupon I went to the Secretary of the Faculty of Science at the Sorbonne and he gave me a provisional card of admission to the course for the certificate in physics, chemistry and biology (the whole year’s work). There are no fees to pay for lectures but the lectures begin at 9 in the morning continuing for an hour or two hours and practical work begins in the afternoon at 1.30 and goes on for two or three hours. There are no written exams: all exams are oral and last about a quarter of a⁠[n] hour. My exam for the certificate will come off July next. I am somewhat late as the last day for demands to the Minister was 1 Dec, but I daresay, as I am a foreigner, I will be excused. I can therefore have a fortnight or so to work between this and Christmas. I have bought an alarm-clock (4 francs) to waken me in time in the mornings as the school is some distance away. I had a bath just now (7½): warm. I can get breakfast for 3d, dejeuner (soup, meat, dessert, coffee) for 8d or 9d and dinner (soup, fish, meat and vegetables, dessert, coffee) for 1s/–. But I am obliged to take coffee constantly through the day. Coffee is taken here during the day without milk but with sugar. This I find to my taste as the weather here is very severe, sometimes going down to 7 or 9 degrees below zero. The wind too is very keen but there is neither fog nor rain. Tell Stannie to go to Eason’s in Abbey St where I ordered and paid for a certain quantity of paper, and tell them to forward it to me. They will do this if the carriage is paid. I forgot it in the hurry of going away. I have not had time yet to work up my letters of introduction—except some—but I shall do so during the week. I have to get an apron and sleeves and a dissecting case at once if I begin work on Monday, and my money will not be due in Paris from Lloyd’s till Thursday. However I daresay I shall manage. I intend next week to look around for a room at about 1£ or 8£ the year—35s/– the three months and engage it from January 1st, and my month will be up in the hotel here on January 3rd and I think the courses will begin again on January 4th. There is magnificent Norman furniture in a shop here—heavy wooden presses with panelled doors—5£ for one about twice as big as your wardrobe and though I cannot buy these yet for my room I shall certainly get them as soon as I can when I have definitely settled myself in Paris for my medical course. No information is to be given about me to anybody except—‘O, Very Nicely, thank you.’ Tell Stannie to send me the December no of S. Stephen’s and to write to the Unicorn Press and to be careful of the books in my room. Jim",
