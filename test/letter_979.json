  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Here is a short note on p 130 of t.13. The Maronite (Roman Catholic) liturgy, the language of which is Syrian is at the back of it. On Good Friday the body of Jesus is unscrewed from the cross, placed in a sheet and carried to the sepulchre while girls dressed in white throw flowers at it and a great deal of incense is used. The Maronite ritual is used in Mount Lebanon. Yb departs like Osiris the body of the young god being pelted and incensed. He is seen as already a Yesterday (Gestern, Guesturning [? turning] back his glance amid wails of ‘Today!’ from To Morrow (to-maronite’s wail etc). The apostrophe balances the hyphen Guesturn’s, Tomaronites. This censing scene is led up to by: licet ut lebanos (p. 12) = this may be used as incense (libanos is Greek for incense) the ‘libans and the sickamours and the babilonias etc’ of Izzy’s rambling remarks the words ‘at my frank incensive’. ‘Idos be’ (idos is also Greek for incense and the name of an ‘artificial tongue’ ‘thurily’ (for thoroughly)—t(h)us—t(h)uris is Latin for incense. ‘Weih?—Up the Shameraugh!’ Weihrauch is German for incense. Here it sounds also shamrock but means a cloudscreen or shamscreen ‘licensed and censered’ p. 13 etc, also ‘sedro’ Syriac for [word illegible]. The choir of girls splits in two = those who pronounce Oahsis and those who pronounce Oeyesis (cf Our Father who/which art etc). The Latin is ‘Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Lebanon etc’ see A.P.O.T.A.A.A.Y.M. Belvedere College chapter. There are in all 29 words in the threnody 6 x 4 = 24 and the final 5 = 29 (Tu autem, Domine, miserere nobis!). This leapyear chorus is repeated lower down in imitation of the Maronite and Latin ‘pax’ given by embrace of arms. The girls do nothing really but turn one to another, exclaiming one another’s name joyfully (Frida! Freda! etc). These are 29 words for ‘Peace’ taken from or modelled on the following tongues and variations (German, DanoNorwegian, Provençal, French, Greek, French variations, Malay, Echo, Gipsy, Magyar childrens, Armenian, Senegalese, Latin variation, Irish, Diminutive, N. Breton, S. Breton, Chinese, Pidgin, Arabic, Hebrew, Sanscrit, Hindustani and English = O for goodness sake leave off!). This word was actually sighed around the world in that way in 1918. Please tell me if you like this treatment of the theme.",
