  "text": "Dear Stannie; Let me know how and where you are. I hope you got over that last bout of renal cattarh. We are here taking the waters as they did a long time ago. It is rather quiet and old-world, thank the lord. I have rented a new flat (empty) in Paris and the workmen are fixing it up. From, say, 1 September or 10 my address will be: 7 rue Edmond Valentin, Paris VIIe (tel: Invalides 50.38). It is between where I lived before, rue de Grenelle, and the Eiffel Tower. People tell me not to settle down as there is going to be a brand new war but I am tired of paying 3 rents à la fois so I took it. I send you the Irish Times, O G’s poem on p. 7 may interest you though the picture of him as a baker’s roundsman delivering 2 loaves, 2 turnovers and a crown in through the skylight seems odd. Also Diarmuid and Grainne on p 15 are instructive. I am sending the money by the month to Eva. Am still without news from U.S. As you know after the judge’s ruling in my favor on 6 December last the book came out but 3 months after the government, urged on by certain elements, lodged an appeal at the 11th hour. The case came up before the court of appeal 9 weeks ago. 3 judges without a jury decided to consider the case at their leisure. I think the U.S. courts rise today for their long vac. (the British are high too) so perhaps I shall hear nothing till October. I have a contract also with John Lane, London, and he writes his lawyers have advised him to run the gauntlet next autumn and bring it out. So I hope there’s no fighting nor no nothing. Did you get the fragment of my new book The Mime of Mick Nick and the Maggies with designs by Lucia. If not, I’ll send you one. She is still at Nyon. I believe she is getting better but it is slow. All the young girls or women or most of them seem to be off the key a little. Giorgio and family are summering and simmering in New York (c/o Mr Adolf Kastor, 1239 Broadway). They aren’t staying there, of course, but at Long Branch, a sort of N.Y. Brighton. I hope to have some news of you. Best wishes to Nelly and yourself from us both Jim",
