  "text": "Dear Sir, Thanks for your card. Before leaving Rome I left my change of address at the GPO but could not acquaint you as I decided on coming here only the very morning of my departure. This will be my address for some time, as I have to deliver a series of lectures here on The Celtic Revival. With regard to your second proofs I have written to a friend of mine in Rome asking him to call on the P.O. authorities and expect his answer tomorrow. I shall write you in any case tomorrow and let you know whether it will be necessary for you to send a fresh batch of proofs which, I fear, may be the case, as the mills of governmental departments in Italy grind exceeding slow. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
