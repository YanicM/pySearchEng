  "text": "Dear Budgen: I sent on your letter to Louis Gillet. He says his copy is marked ‘4th impression’. I hope those publishers give you royalties on these editions and that you didn’t sell the rights off. My biography by Gorman is published by Farrar and Rinehart of New York at 3$50. I believe, if you had a good agent, you could dispose of the U.S. rights of your book just now. I enclose the Dutch article. Please send it back when read as I want it for the files. The Roman review Prospettive has just published my Italian version of Anna Livia with articles on the writer and his latest book, Ettore Settanni writes me that it is causing ‘un gran scompiglio nel mondo letterario’. (Great uproar) I did not wish to inflict temporal art on a spatialist in asking you to go to the concert. I was struck by the similarity of the two 39 Belsizes and being a superstitious Cornishman felt I had to do something about it. I am sorry your wall humptydumptied like that. Possibly you had flung your copy of Finn again his Wake onto the top of it. However it is pleasing to know you are working for A L P, that is, if I read aright. Alas, my daughter-in-law is in a very bad way. Everything is in confusion. I am arranging to transfer Lucia here to Moulins in the vicinity. Why despair of placing your very good article somewhere and getting paid for it? It is a pity the unimaginative Curtius sailed past you in the Fortnightly. But there are others. Greetings to you both sincerely yours James Joyce",
