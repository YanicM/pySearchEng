  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I delayed answering your letter as I wanted to have some definite news to send. I have it now. I have signed a lease for an empty flat—this after daily search for the past 4 months. It is in the first street to the right off Ave. Bosquet, turning your back to the river, 7 rue Edmond Valentin. We have work to do in it but I expect it will be habitable by September. Civil strife is reported to be in the air here and general Armageddon to be mobilising outside but I can’t help it. My forty months of wandering in the wilderness must come to an end. It is risky for I don’t know how the appeal court will rule in N.Y. and my rent-paying power depends on the judges. But my wife’s nerves were giving out and, though I have been working about 5 to 7 hours a day for some time—as much as I can do in such heat—I need more elbow room. … But now listen to this. Two years ago I arranged with Burns and Oates through Mr Holroyd Reece (of Albatross Press in Europe) to publish Lucia’s alphabet for Chaucer’s A.B.C. I agreed to pay them £225, to get Gillet to write a preface and have it done into English. This was done but they showed no sign of life so I got the Hague Press which did the last fragment to take on the job. Now for six months I have been writing a good dozen letters to have the lettrines sent back. All kinds of excuses. They are in London, in Grasse, locked up in Paris etc. Now it seems Reece does not know where they are. The blockheads have lost them. They keep on writing vapid letters in the style of Pinker and Cape, about ‘getting into touch’ and ‘lose no time’ ‘how very much we feel’ but the letters are not to be found. And the Xmas market the Dutch publisher had in view is now lost. Voila! I have also been making vigorous efforts to get rid of Pinker, but Léon hangs on to one leg here and Mr Monro to the other in London so that I have had to give up the idea…. We don’t know what to do with ourselves this summer and I wish it were over. Thanks for the list of errors in the fragment. That is rather a pity. This may interest you. Léon began to read to me from a scientific publication about Irish trees. The first sentence was to the effect that the oldest tree in the island is the elm tree in the demesne of Howth Castle and Environs. I hope you are keeping well and I am glad to have something positive to report instead of my usual wail. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
