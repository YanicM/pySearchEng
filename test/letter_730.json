  "text": "Dear Hueffer: The name and address of the Nice doctor are: Dr A Colin rue Gioffreddo 30 Nice hours 2–4 p.m. If you see him you may tell him I have postponed the ‘dionine’ experiment till after the holidays—16 inst—then the other abscesses are to be lanced and then closed (that is, the iridectomy operation in February). You can have confidence in him, I think. I am glad you are having a pleasant stay down there. I suppose you never go to Mentone but if you do I have a favour to ask. On the bridge that is between France and Italy there are some old Italian women who sell shell cameos (camées de coquilles) for about 10 francs. I should like to have one at your choice for the one I bought there and had mounted on a gold circlet the femme de menage has stolen together with a nice brooch and God knows what else. Don’t give yourself the least trouble about this, only if you happen to be there perhaps you will buy one. The Italian woman will probably begin by asking a few thousand for it just to make talk. Many thanks in advance and kind regards Sincerely yours James Joyce",
