  "text": "Dear Stannie, This is our new address. I hope you are both well. Lucia is still very ill and Helen has had a bad nervous breakdown. Giorgio’s career as a singer is again held up. My book Finnegans Wake will be published May 4. It is very expensive for these times. 25/– (Faber & Faber, London.) Only 14 copies (press) are available for European critics. I should like to send 2 to Italy. Can you suggest 2 Italian critics who would be likely to review it. I thought of Emilio Cecchi as one. Let me know please by return. Or should I send one to Benco? Will you also please tell my old pupil Marcello Rogers I got his letter and have today written to his friend Giorgio. I don’t know whether I can do much but shall try. Jim P.S. Six copies are for here, 5 for Germany and 2 for Denmark, 1 each Norway and Holland.",
