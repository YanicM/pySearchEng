  "text": "My dear distant Nora I saw Roberts today and we spoke of the binding &c of my book so that a ray of hope has sprung out of the clouds. He told me to call back tomorrow at 12. I have taken a double-bedded room at 21 Richmond Place on the North Circular Road and I am foolish enough to hope that you and I may be able to spend some happy days after all this trouble. How I should love to go about with you during Horse Show Week and have money to take you here and there. I can get passes for the theatres. Be sure to have nice petticoats and stockings. You can have your hair dressed here. Have you the grey ribbon I like so much? Would you come up tomorrow? I am afraid to ask because Stannie has not written to me and my money is almost at an end. Perhaps he will write tomorrow. I have passed a terribly exciting week over my book. Roberts spoke to me today of my novel, and asked me to finish it. Would you like to come to the theatre with me and have supper together afterwards? I hope you are as plump as you were? Is your tight naughty lilac blouse clean? I hope you clean your teeth. If you don’t look well I will send you back to Galway. Be sure not to break your hats especially the high one. I have a nice room in the front with two beds. If all goes well could we not pass a few days in each other’s company. I should like to show you many places in Dublin that are mentioned in my book. I wish you were here. You have become a part of myself—one flesh. When we go back to Trieste will you read if I give you books? Then we could speak together. Nobody loves you as I do and I should love to read the different poets and dramatists and novelists with you as your guide. I will give you only what is finest and best in writing. Poor Jim! He is always planning and planning! I hope I shall have good news tomorrow. If only my book is published then I will plunge into my novel and finish it. The Abbey Theatre will be open and they will give plays of Yeats and Synge. You have a right to be there because you are my bride: and I am one of the writers of this generation who are perhaps creating at last a conscience in the soul of this wretched race. Addio! Jim (Write as usual to Todd Burns not to my address)",
