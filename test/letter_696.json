  "text": "Dear McAlmon: God only knows when I am likely to get that holiday. Darantière is driving me out of any wits I have left. In a month he has not sent me any copies and it is impossible to get press copies out of him. I have to stay on and sign the rest of the de luxe lot. Besides I was on the track of two flats. One has collapsed but the other is still possible. How long are you staying there? I hope you are not annoyed at my not writing one way or the other. If you were at this end you would appreciate the situation. Have you finished Ulysses? If so I should like to hear your complete opinion. There are heaps of misprints in the last two episodes. I suppose you have done a bundle by now instead of a bunch. A journalist called on me yesterday to ask what I am writing now!!! I am sure it is very pleasant down there. The only thing would give me any consolation is a nice necktie so if you feel inclined to throw any into the winedark sea remember me. A child is easily satisfied. But don’t send me more than one or I shall feel very mean…. Please let me hear from you in any case and excuse this bewildered bewildering author.",
