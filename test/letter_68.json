  "text": "Dear Stannie I have not yet received the papers you were to despatch to me and I shall be glad if you will also send the old ‘Speaker’ as Nora has lost the one I gave her. Have you any news of Grant Richards or of the ‘Venture’. I have written to Baillie but no reply. I am half way through Chap XIII and if you like will send you Chaps XII and XIII before Xmas for your opinion. What of H J have you read? I have read ‘Madonna of the Future’ and found it very pleasant reading. I am reading the Souvenirs of Renan. Damme if I understand him. ‘Un Celte, mêlé de Gascon, mâtiné de Lappon’ ‘un prêtre manqué’. He professes romanticism, love for Brittany, affection for old masters, regret at having to abandon dear old Grandmother Church—I fancy his life of Jesus must be very maudlin stuff. No wonder Huysmans calls him a comedian. Have you any news from the Hotel. Nora’s father is a baker. They are seven in family. Papa had a shop but drank all the buns and loaves like a man. The mother’s family are ‘toney’ and (by the way, do you ever see Paddy Lee?) intervened. Sequestration of Papa. Uncle Michael supports Mrs and the children, while Papa bakes and drinks in a distant part of Connacht. Uncle M is very rich. Papa is treated very contemptuously by the family. Nora says her mother would not lie with him. Nora has not lived at home but with her grandmother who has left her some money. She has told me something of her youth, and admits the gentle art of self-satisfaction. She has had many love-affairs, one when quite young with a boy who died. She was laid up at news of his death. Her uncles are worthy men as you shall hear. When she was sixteen a curate in Galway took a liking to her: tea at the presbytery, little chats, familiarity. He was a nice young man with black curly hairs on his head. One night at tea he took her on his lap and said he liked her, she was a nice little girl. Then he put his hand up under her dress which was shortish. She however, I understand, broke away. Afterwards he told her to say in confession it was a man not a priest did ‘that’ to her. Useful difference. She used to go with Mulvey (he was a Protestant) and walk about the roads with him at time⁠[s]. Says she didn’t love him and simply went to pass the time. She was opposed at home and this made her persist. Her uncle got on the track. Every night he would be at home before her. ‘Well, my girl, out again with your Protestant.’ Forbade her to go any more. She went. When she came home uncle was there before her. Her mother was ordered out of the room (Papa of course was away) and uncle proceeded to thrash her with a big walking-stick. She fell on the floor fainting and clinging about his knees. At this time she was nineteen! Pretty little story, eh? With regard to the Holy Office you may imagine I have not much money to spare. They have sent me a bill for 10s/6d but [if you l]⁠ook among my papers I [am sure] you will find a bill for 7/6 [and you] ought to be able to raise [that much] now since there is money [coming]. I think the Holy Office is so clever that I shall however send you next week an order for 2s/– leaving you to get the rest. I should like you to study by yourself or with Cosgrave some midwifery and embryology and to send me the results of your study. I sent a picture card to May and if you like I will send you one too. As for our way of living. We get out of bed at nine and Nora makes chocolate. At midday we have lunch which we (or rather she) buys, cooks (soup, meat, potatoes and something else) in a locanda opposite. At four o’clock we have chocolate and at eight o’clock dinner which Nora cooks. The⁠[n] [we go] to the Caffé Miramar w⁠[here we read] the ‘Figaro’ of Paris and we [come] back about midnight. Eyers, [the] other English teacher, is a lovely pianist and we sometimes have music. He too, though very unripe, is falling under the Daedalean spell, I fancy. I have got somewhat fat and am going to the dentist next week. I shall spend the ‘Speaker’ cheque on my teeth and I hope in six months to have all my teeth settled. Do you ever see Dana and did they print my obscene song ‘Bid adieu’? I read Nora Chap XI which she thought remarkable but she cares nothing for my art. Ask hairy Jaysus what am I to do? He ought to know. Jim",
