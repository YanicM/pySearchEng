  "text": "Dear Budgen: First of all many happy returns of your birthday and secondly my regards and apologies to Mr and Mrs Sargent for not having acknowledged safe receipt of the book sent me. What a time! A rent (£300) which keeps me in continual fever, running about here and there, mortgaging my income in advance. Then up every night till three or even later writing. Circe is finished long ago also Eumeus and I am writing Ithaca. I have dreadful worries about a typist. Four declined to do Circe, at last one admirer(ess) volunteered. She started, but when she had done 100 pp her father got a seizure in the street (a Circean episode) and now my MS is written out in fairhand by someone who passes it to someone else who sends it to be typed. I sent Eumeus to a third typist. A hysterical letter from the translatress of the Portrait. No word or syllable of a word from Pound. I had a letter from Mr Valery Larbaud (French translator of S. Butler and novelist) says he has read Ulysses and is raving mad over it, that Bloom is as immortal as Falstaff (except that he has some few more years to live—Editor) and that the book is as great as Rabelais (Merde du bon Dieu et foutre de nom de nom—comment of Monsieur François). I shall send you both chapters as soon as possible…. I suffer from frightful attacks of neuralgia. Sargent tells me you feel twinges of rheumatism. Beware of it. Some determined effort should be made to right affairs generally but all I can do is to slave along at Bloom, curse him. I am writing Ithaca in the form of a mathematical catechism. All events are resolved into their cosmic, physical, psychical etc. equivalents, e.g. Bloom jumping down the area, drawing water from the tap, the micturating in the garden, the cone of incense, lighted candle and statue so that the reader will know everything and know it in the baldest and coldest way, but Bloom and Stephen thereby become heavenly bodies, wanderers like the stars at which they gaze. The last word (human all-too-human) is left to Penelope. This is the indispensable countersign to Bloom’s passport to eternity. I mean the last episode, Penelope. Now dear friend, being some twenty-eight days older than you, I take the liberty of suggesting that some kind of end be put to this tomfool existence we are both leading. Mine is more absurd than yours. Let me know how you are getting on, if you have sold anything or if you are travelling for soap. O, my prophetic soul when I put soap in Ulysses’ pocket. I am putting all sorts of lies in the mouth of that sailorman in Eumeus which will make you laugh. At one time I thought the slaughter of the suitors un-Ulyssean. In my present frame of mind I have modified my opinion. Schluss! Prosit! And to our next meeting with song and dance as in 1919 of blastedly expensive memory. ad multos annos.",
