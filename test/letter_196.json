  "text": "Dear Sir I do not know whether Mr Symons told you when he spoke to you about me that I have a second book ready for publication. It is a book of fifteen stories entitled ‘Dubliners’, and as you have published my first book I think it is right that I should offer it to you in the first instance. At the same time I do not know whether you publish books of prose or not nor do I know whether the result of ‘Chamber Music’ from your point of view was such as to warrant you in considering any other book of mine with a view of publishing. I would be glad therefore to hear from you on this matter at your earliest convenience as in any case I should like to have the matter definitely arranged this autumn either with you or with another publisher so that the book might appear next spring. I may mention that ‘Dubliners’ was accepted for publication by a London publishing house which afterwards did not see its way to stand by its agreement. The signed agreement of the above house is still in my possession. Hoping to hear from you by return, I am Yours faithfully, Jas A Joyce",
