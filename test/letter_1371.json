  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion, Here is Dr Berman’s reply to my letter from Z’ch!!! I hope the news of your daughter is better. I was with Lucia all Xmas afternoon. She is better but my opinion is she is not yet in a stable state. However, she is hopeful herself. Perhaps this year will cure her. Giorgio and Helen have to leave for New York at practically a moment’s notice as her father is gravely ill—operation to take place on Monday. We passed a bad Xmas and look as if we were going to have a worse S. Sylvester Night! Nevertheless, good luck to you both for ’38. transition held up. At the last moment I decided to collaborate! I hope to finish W.i.P. for 2 Feb. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
