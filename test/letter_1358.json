  "text": "Dear Mr Kastor: My wife and I have waited for some time before venturing to convey to you our deep sympathy with you in the all but tragic event which has taken place in your family. It now seems as if the worst were really no longer to be dreaded and therefore I am writing to say that we hope in spite of what has happened that eventually some good may come of it. It is a terrible affliction to be cast upon you at your age and it is a terrible trial for your poor son for whom everybody I know that knows him has esteem and affection. We ourselves for the past six years have undergone a dreadful strain on account of our daughter Lucia whose happy and promising youth has been blighted by another but perhaps even more incurable form of mental or moral derangement. I have used the word ‘incurable’ because it was used so often by doctors to me but it is entirely false. After that long ordeal to herself and to us she is, in the opinion of everyone, slowly coming round again. The famous Russian ballet dancer Nijinsky has been pronounced also ‘incurable’ for the past eighteen years. Yet according to Dr Binswamer here (whose brother has him in charge at Kreuzlingen) he also is on the road to recovery in consequence of an insulin or glandular treatment. Your son’s case cannot be nearly so bad as his (in spite of what has happened) and very possibly the awful shock to himself may have the effect of restoring the balance of his mind and bringing the will to live and be happy again to the sufferer in spite of the malady’s workings. I sincerely trust that this may be so. The actual physical disfigurement might be much worse as a result of a train or a machinery accident and it may prove to be only a tribute which he had to pay in order to buy off a demoniac possession. I hope therefore to hear from Helen that time as it goes on will heal not only the physical but the spiritual wounds and that you yourself will soon find some solace in the certitude that an irreparable loss has been averted. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
