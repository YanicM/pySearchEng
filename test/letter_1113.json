  "text": "Dear Mr Cerf, I thank you very much for your message conveyed to me by Mr Robert Kastor. You ask me for details of the story of the publication of Ulysses and since you are determined to fight for its legalisation in the United States and to publish what will be the only authentic edition there, I think it just as well to tell you the history of its publication in Europe and the complications which followed it in America, although I was under the impression that they were already well known. As it is, however, they have given my book in print a life of its own. Habent sua fata libelli! You are surely well aware of the difficulties I found in publishing anything I wrote from the very first volume of prose I attempted to publish: Dubliners. Publishers and printers alike seemed to agree among themselves, no matter how divergent their points of view were in other matters, not to publish anything of mine as I wrote it. No less than twenty-two publishers and printers read the manuscript of Dubliners and when at last it was printed some very kind person bought out the entire edition and had it burnt in Dublin—a new and private auto-da-fé. Without the collaboration of the Egoist Press Ltd. London, conducted by Miss Harriet Weaver The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Mail might still be in manuscript. You can well imagine that when I came to Paris in the summer 1920 with the voluminous manuscript of Ulysses I stood even slenderer chances of finding a publisher on account of its suppression after the publication of the eleventh episode in the Little Review conducted by Miss Margaret Anderson and Miss Jane Heap. These two editors were, as you probably remember, prosecuted at the instance of some society and as a result further publication in serial form was prohibited, the existing copies were confiscated and, I believe, the fingerprints of the two ladies were taken. The completed manuscript, however, was offered to one of your colleagues on the American market but I greatly doubt that he even took the trouble to glance at it. My friend Mr Ezra Pound and good luck brought me into contact with a very clever and energetic person Miss Sylvia Beach who had been running for some years previously a small English bookshop and lending library in Paris under the name of Shakespeare and Co. This brave woman risked what professional publishers did not wish to, she took the manuscript and handed it to the printers. These were very scrupulous and understanding French printers in Dijon, the capital of the French printing press. In fact I attached no small importance to the work being done well and quickly. My eyesight still permitted me at that time to read the proofs myself and thus it came about that thanks to extra work and the kindness of Mr Darantière the well-known Dijon printer Ulysses came out a very short time after the manuscript had been delivered and the first printed copy was sent to me for my fortieth birthday on the second of February 1922. You are however in error when you think that Shakespeare and Co. never published anything before or after Ulysses. As a matter of fact Miss Sylvia Beach brought out a little volume of thirteen poems of mine entitled Pomes Penyeach in 1927 and also a volume of essays and two letters of protest concerning the book I am engaged in writing since 1922. This volume was brought out in 1929 and it bears the title of Our Exagmination round his factification for incamination of Work in Progress. The continental publication of Ulysses proved however to be merely the beginning of complications in the United Kingdom and the United States. Shipments of copies of Ulysses were made to America and to Great Britain with the result that all copies were seized and burnt by the Custom authorities of New York and Folkestone. This created a very peculiar situation. On the one hand I was unable to acquire the copyright in the United States since I could not comply with the requirements of the American copyright law which demands the republication in the United States of any English book published elsewhere within a period of six months after the date of such publication, and on the other hand the demand for Ulysses which increased every year in proportion as the book penetrated into larger circles gave the opportunity for any unscrupulous person to have it printed and sold clandestinely. This practice provoked a protest signed by one hundred and sixty-seven writers of all nationalities and I even obtained an injunction against one of these unscrupulous persons in a New York court. I am enclosing copies of both these documents which may interest you. This injunction, however, proved of no avail as the enjoined defendant resumed his practice very soon again under another name and with a different mode of procedure, namely a photographic forgery of the Paris edition which contained the falsification of the Dijon printer’s imprint. It is therefore with the greatest sincerity that I wish you all possible success in your courageous venture both as regards the legalisation of Ulysses as well as its publication and I willingly certify hereby that not only will your edition be the only authentic one in the United States but also the only one there on which I will be receiving royalties. Personally I will be very gratified if your enterprise is successful as it will permit American readers who have always proved very kind to me to obtain the authenticated text of my book without running the risk of helping some unscrupulous person in his purpose of making profit for himself alone out of the work of another to which he can advance no claim of moral ownership. There may be some other points in which you are interested and I hope that should you be over in Europe again this year you will oblige me by communicating with me either direct or through my son so as to enable me to elucidate any point you may still be in doubt about. Yours sincerely James Joyce",
