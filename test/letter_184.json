  "text": "Dear Stannie I received yr. wire but no message. I gave notice here on Thursday. If I will be permitted I will resume teaching at the school. Artif. promised me I could go back when I liked. I have 9, 10 hrs a day work: a little more pay in a much dearer city. Since I came here I have not put pen to paper. I would write fully but am hourly awaiting your news. A little more of this life and J.F.B.’s prophecy would be fulfilled. I have no ‘carriera’ before me in commerce. Not because I can’t make one, but because I won’t. Jim",
