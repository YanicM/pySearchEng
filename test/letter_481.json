  "text": "Dear Mr Sykes: I send you M.O. (10 frs) and second episode to be typed as soon as possible. They promise to send me £10 when I send MS of first part—of which there is a third episode. Please leave a good margin on the left side of the page not on the right. T wo small alterations. In account of Sir John Blackwood place also after the second Day! … dots as after the first so (Day! … Day! . ..). In Mr Deasy’s speech beginning ‘You think me an old fogey’ place after ‘I remember the famine’ the date ‘in ’46.[’] Hope you will not find the MS difficult. I tried to write in a very legible hand but there are interlineations, very important. Hope you can make them out. When sending back please send registered. Can you do 3 copies as last time? Is it the same for you. It is in case one goes astray. Please let me know if MO’s sent square accounts, including of course postage and expenses of Dienstmann. Kind regards to Mrs Sykes and yourself James Joyce P.S. I hope you will like the MS.",
