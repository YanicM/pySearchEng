  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Many thanks for cheque remitted and kindly thank also Mr Huebsch for his prompt reply. I am glad you have almost disposed of the Danish rights and hope the matter will soon be finished and the amount paid over. Is there any chance that Mr Lennox Robinson, manager of Abbey Theatre, Dublin, would put on Exiles? Is there not a clause in my contract with Mr Richards which states that the publisher forfeits right to republish if he does not use it within a certain time? I mention this because many people complain that they cannot buy Dubliners. I enclose a letter from New York which explains itself. Of course Mr Huebsch is to have the refusal. The text hitherto published in Little Review is not my text as sent on in typescript. The book is to be published as I wrote it with a few additions on the proof. With many thanks Sincerely yours James Joyce",
