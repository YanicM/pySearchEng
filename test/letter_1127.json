  "text": "Dear Eliot: … Vogt saw me and you will get from Léon an account of the very unpleasant surprise that awaited me here. He is keeping me under observation. What am I to do about my book? Of course I can always refund the advance if I have to abandon it. But I want to finish it. Impossible to write in such circumstances. I may have to remain 4–6 months here. I hope you do not believe it is any bad faith on my part. And the money it all costs! Good Lord! And this place is so dear. I mean Switzerland. We stop at this hotel because my wife is exhausted by it all and must have a week or so rest and comfort…. I really do not know what to do about W.i.P.",
