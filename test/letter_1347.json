  "text": "Dear Curran: Don’t be alarmed by this bloody letter and the five times [?] France on the envelope. My pen is charged with gore because the work on the proofs of Pts I & III of W i P is now so involved that I have to recur to my old habit of coloured inks and pencil and the stamp is intended to help les chômeurs intellectuels. In fact I am treading this winepress all alone though of the Currans there is one with me and as today is S. Bastille I am sending you the twelve apostles; each of whom is named Patrick and is a bottle unto himself. Wine from the royal Pope will cross the ocean green better at present than Spanish ale which is reported to be rather heady. I was greatly pleased by your kind present but why the date 1935? For years I have been trying to get any of E.H.’s libretti for pantomime. Perhaps you will find one some day. Especially Turko the Terrible. My father’s old friend R.J. Thornton (‘Tom Kernan’) used to tell me about Giuglini flying his big kite on Sandymount strand when he was a boy. He went mad some years later. Dubliners put him above Mario even as a tenor. Selskar Gunn (without an ‘e’) used to come with us to the opera to hear Sullivan. He is the son of Michael Gunn. The brother James was a good friend of my father’s and they used to listen at the back of the darkened theatre sometimes when Tietjens and Trebelli were rehearsing. He told me his sister Haidée had drawn his attention to the many allusions to her father and mother (‘Bessie Sudlow’) in W. i. P. Gorman and Mrs Gorman had dinner with me a few nights ago. I had not met him since his return. I asked him had anybody mentioned Sullivan. No. Or opera. No. Or singing. Not a word. Ichabod. He said he had a grand time in Eire but at Clongowes it seems the password was ‘O, breathe not his name’. Surely this was an excess of prudence on your part. However, I leave it to you, as the man with the hump said to his son. By way of Clongowes Fr Conmee used to say my letters home were like grocer’s lists. Sono sempre quello. For I am sending you another £2 & ten 10/- and I would like you to exhaust the amount in the purchase of all the songs available by French, Ashcroft, Wheatley and Vousden and Ariel. and when the £2½ is finished let me know and I will remit more. I should like these soon. I know most of them but want them, if possible, in low keys. Who is the Val. Vousden whose name I sometimes see. A grandson? I remember the old man. The last time I saw him was making a patriarchal entry into the Black Maria outside Store Street. He had a long white beard, typifying the wisdom of the morning after. Also at what price can I buy last year’s Dublin Directory and Who’s Who. If I order them from here they will charge me full rates which is absurd as old Casey used to say. Some doctors and people who saw Lucia lately agree that she is much better than 2½ years ago. What a dreadful trial to be laid on any girl’s shoulders! I had arranged for her to go out on a motor ride today but there’s the rain in bucketfulls! Pas de chance! The 26th is her birthday. Will you please send her a message (not a present, it’s too complicated with the customs)…. She will be delighted to see that people remember her. I mean just a word from Mrs Curran and yourself. Merci d’avance. I met Gillet for a moment in the vestibule at the opera—the ballets, it was rotten and not good, the English. I had not time to talk to him as he wanted to. He enjoyed his stay greatly and then added: I also saw the president. A look of anguish and distraction came over his operatic countenance (he was to have been a deep bass, trained for the stage) and having said his line he went out into the night. The money is in another envelope. When are you coming to Paname? I want the exact date if possible. Raining greetings to A.L.P.",
