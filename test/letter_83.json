  "text": "Dear Stannie While I was attending the Greek mass here last Sunday it seemed to me that my story The Sisters was rather remarkable. The Greek mass is strange. The altar is not visible but at times the priest opens the gates and shows himself. He opens and shuts them about six times. For the Gospel he comes out of a side gate and comes down into the chapel and reads out of a book. For the elevation he does the same. At the end when he has blessed the people he shuts the gates: a boy comes running down the side of the chapel with a large tray full of little lumps of bread. The priest comes after him and distributes the lumps to scrambling believers. Damn droll! The Greek priest has been taking a great eyeful out of me: two haruspices. I have now finished another chapter and am at Chapter XX. This is a terrible opus: I wonder how I have the patience to write it. Do you think other people will have the patience to read it? The other English teacher here said to me last night as he looked at my suit ‘I often notice that eccentric people have very little taste: they wear anything. I give you a tip. If you have no taste you go in for grey. Stick to grey. Doesn’t matter what kind—always looks gentlemanly’. Now, this seems to me on mature reflection a bloody awful position for me to be in. Some day I shall clout my pupils about the head, I fear, and stalk out. I wish you would send me the key of my trunk as I want to sell it and buy a valise. A trunk here is a third passenger to pay for. My trunk from London to Trieste cost me about £1. If you do not dispose of ‘Hallow Eve’ at once, send the MS back as I shall send it to the London ‘Daily Mail.’ Get me at once a copy of the will of Catherine Healy—born Mortimer—who was married to—Healy and died in Abbeygate St, Galway, in the year 1895, 6 or 7. Read the will yourself and send me a copy at once. You can get the will in the Record Office of the Four Courts in Dublin. Also find out if Nora can get her birth certificate by writing to the Registrar General’s office as we may want it. If you see Cosgrave tell him that he is in my novel under the name of Lynch. Address your next letter to Berlitz School 32 Via S. Nicolo as I leave here on Sunday. I have received your letter. I see three London papers regularly so some of it was not news but I am damn glad to get letters. While I was reading it in the school, one of my pupils passed through, a vulgar little Hungarian, saying flatly ‘Good morning, sar’ to which I replied with intention ‘The divil bite your bottom’. Honestly it is awful! Send that will on at once and the key. ‘Sometime fornicator … spiritual love’ O, fie! fie! is that one for me? How did Buckley kill the Russian general? I have now finished Chaps XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX and am now at Chap XXI. Why don’t you send me back my chapters? My health is not very good. I do not like Confidence: it bores me dreadfully and Peter Simple doesn’t. Read the end of Chap XVII: I think it is well written. O blast Rincora! Nora is reading the slip by fits and starts to a tune of ‘Old Tom Gregory, Has a big menagerie’, which seems to me what old Thornton would have called a double entente. Jim Nora says she hopes you’re well and have a nice girl. JAYSOOS!",
