I have been having a very anxious time with my wife who was operated here on 8 November last. I am in here to keep her company as the operation and still more the treatment make her highly nervous. She is getting on well these last weeks. As for myself I can write at last as you see but cannot see any print yet, not even my own, alas! Jeg onsker Dem en glaedelig Jul og et godt Nytår. På gensyn! Sincerely yours James Joyce",
