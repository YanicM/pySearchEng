  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I enclosed [sic] the article I spoke of. The biographical part of it is such a grotesque distortion of facts that I scarcely know what to say all the more as I know the writer for the past ten years and he must have lost his memory. You figure in it as an ‘American admirer’ and I as a kind of cardinal Mezzofanti speaking ‘18 European and oriental languages’! The intention of course is friendly so there the matter ends. The séance went very well. In the middle of the Cyclops episode the light went out very much as it did for the Cyclops himself but the audience was very patient. Strange to say Mr Larbaud’s biographical introduction also contained a number of misstatements though I had answered many times the questions he asked me. Nobody seems to be inclined to present me to the world in my unadorned prosaicness. At the last moment he decided to cut part of the Penelope fragment but as he told me so only when he was walking to the table I accepted it. I daresay what he read was bad enough in all conscience but there was no sign of any kind of protest and had he read the few extra lines the equilibrium of the solar system would not have been greatly disturbed. I ought now to attack the formidable problem of that money but I get so many proofs (I enclose more) by two posts a day that I cannot say much beyond this that your suggestion that it should be invested is one that I agree with in principle. Still if that were done now I might possibly run short of resources between now and the time of publication which might be postponed so that perhaps it is best not to do so. I am sometimes tormented by the fear that the printinghouse will be burned or some untoward event occur at the very last moment. Would you like to see the cover of Ulysses? I believe there are some typist’s errors in that plan I sent you. In one of his allusions Mr Larbaud welded two episodes together. Seemingly such an attitude is compatible with much understanding of the book and friendliness towards its writer. There are only about 180 pages more to print I should say so that very soon these—and a great many other points can be put to the test by throwing the book to the world. I am sure that this letter is rather more puzzleheaded than usual but the printer, for some reason, sends me now proofs of Circe, Eumeus and Penelope at the same time without having finished the composition of the first two and I have to work on them simultaneously different as they are so that I remind myself of the man who used to play several instruments with different parts of his body. I have heard that a parody of the book entitled Ulysses Junior appears in the New York Herald. They might have waited till the poor senior was properly ‘home from the sea’. I also hear that one of the writers of the futurist group here stimulated by Ulysses has begun a work to be entitled Telemachus. I wish him joy. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
