  "text": "Dear Mrs. Schmitz: I enclose a letter from my friend Mr. Ford which please return to me when read. Will you see that the publishers communicate with him as soon as possible. He is very well known in America and his introduction ought to be of great help. If Mr. Herbert Gorman who is writing my life has written to you, you may reply to him if you feel inclined to do so, as he has my authorisation. If my brother who lives at number 6 via Cesare Battisti has a telephone, can you please ring him up? He has also been written to by Mr. Gorman but has not replied and my son sent him about ten days ago a very extraordinary letter which had been forwarded to me from some person who calls himself Gianni Corte, living in Via del Teatro Vecchio, Capodistria who seems to be either a madman or a blackmailer or a practical joker or all three combined. My brother was asked to have this matter investigated but he has not replied to that either. The letter was addressed to me in a wrong name somewhat like my own and to my publishers also wrongly spellt at an incorrect address, but the french post managed to deliver it. Will you therefore please ask my brother or if he is too busy my sister-in-law to let us have a letter as soon as possible. With kind remembrances from us all, and best wishes for the success of ‘As a Man Grows Older’ sincerely yours James Joyce",
