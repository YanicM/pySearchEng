  "text": "Dear Stannie, It would have been useless to have made that suggestion to Pace. I never go there at all. I might have gone on eating in the other trattoria and then at the end of the month I might have asked for credit for a week or so. But that would mean L 40 or L 50 out of my pocket on the 1st. So I gave Nora L 50 to see if we could live a fortnight on it. Four days have now passed and she has 25 lire left. But, she has also bought oil and lamp-oil and coal and candles—all of which will reduce our landlady’s bill on the 1st of Dec. (This month it was L 52.–) and she has three quarters of a bag of coal left, a big bag of coffee, a good deal of sugar and five litres of wine. Had we gone on living out we would have spent L 6.– at least per day: and would now have the L 25.0, which we have,—and nothing else. So I think we have begun at last. The only thing is the plan is risky for, if I cannot get a pupil before the end of the month we have nowhere to get credit. But I prefer even to risk this as I am determined to save money. I sent my verses to Elkin Mathews, telling him they had been for two years in bond and requesting an early decision. He writes, saying it could not be published this side of Xmas but that as soon as he has got some pressing WORK off his hands he will turn to and examine it. The Soc. of Authors wants £1–1–0 subscription. The barrister advised me not to go on with the case for reason before explained to you. I thanked him and asked him what his fee was and he said =£1–0–0. So I paid 10 L and said I would give him the rest on the 1st of December. I also gave him Two Gallants to read. He said he read it with great interest and pleasure but thought it would read better in French or Italian. He has promised to examine all my future contracts, advises me to wait until my verses are published and then to send Dubliners to some publisher accompanied by a bundle of press notices. I have read Gissing’s Demos: A Story of English Socialism,. Why are English novels so terribly boring? I think G. has little merit. The socialist in this is first a worker, and then inherits a fortune, jilts his first girl, marries a lydy, becomes a big employer and takes to drink. You know the kind of story. There is a clergyman in it with searching eyes, and a deep voice who makes all the socialists wince under his firm gaze. I am going to read another book of his. Then I will try Arthur Morrison and Hardy: and finally Thackeray. Without boasting I think I have little or nothing to learn from English novelists. I have written to A.J asking her to send me By the Stream of Kilmeen [sic] a book of stories by Seamas O’Kelly—you remember him. He was in the degree class with me. I also asked her to try to lay hands on any old editions of Kickham, Griffin, Carleton, H.J. Smyth &c, Banim and to send me a Xmas present made up of tram-tickets, advts, handbills, posters, papers, programmes &c. I would like to have a map of Dublin on my wall. I suppose I am becoming something of a maniac. I am writing to her today to know how you spell Miss McCleod’s (P) Reel. I have also added in the story The Clay the name of Maria’s laundry, the Dublin by Lamplight Laundry, it is such a gentle way of putting it. I expect there will be no holding the Marquis of Lorne whenever he sees my book. I suppose you read about Skeff and his papa-in-law? They harangued student Dublin from a car outside the University Buildings and U. Coll., because God Save the King was played on the organ. ‘There was a lady in the vehicle,’ the paper says. David said he was proud that day of Nationalist Dublin. I am glad you have a suit at last. Did Bertelli never write after that time? Item. A lamp chimney here costs one lira! I am still suffering from this indigestion. The druggist gave me last night a box of rhubarb pills and told me I should see a doctor if it did not get better. It is about four or five days since I had the pleasure of defecating. I believe this is the result of my sedentary life. I was always accustomed to walking a good deal. You ask me what I would substitute for parliamentary agitation in Ireland. I think the Sinn Fein policy would be more effective. Of course I see that its success would be to substitute Irish for English capital but no-one, I suppose, denies that capitalism is a stage of progress. The Irish proletariat has yet to be created. A feudal peasantry exists, scraping the soil but this would with a national revival or with a definite preponderance of England surely disappear. I quite agree with you that Griffith is afraid of the priests—and he has every reason to be so. But, possibly, they are also a little afraid of him too. After all, he is holding out some secular liberty to the people and the Church doesn’t approve of that. I quite see, of course, that the Church is still, as it was in the time of Adrian IV, the enemy of Ireland: but, I think, her time is almost up. For either Sinn Fein or Imperialism will conquer the present Ireland. If the Irish programme did not insist on the Irish language I suppose I could call myself a nationalist. As it is, I am content to recognise myself an exile: and, prophetically, a repudiated one. You complain of Griffith’s using Gogarty & Co. How do you expect him to fill his paper: he can’t write it all himself. The part he does write, at least, has some intelligence and directness about it. As for O.G I am waiting for the S.F. policy to make headway in the hope that he will join it for no doubt whatever exists in my mind but that, if he gets the chance and the moment comes, he will play the part of MacNally and Reynolds. I do not say this out of spleen. It is my final view of his character: a very native Irish growth, and if I begin to write my novel again it is in this way I shall treat them. If it is not far-fetched to say that my action, and that of men like Ibsen &c, is a virtual intellectual strike I would call such people as Gogarty and Yeats and Colm the blacklegs of literature. Because they have tried to substitute us, to serve the old idols at a lower rate when we refused to do so for a higher. Of course you find my socialism thin. It is so and unsteady and ill-informed. You are wrong, however, in supposing that the intellectuals taught Labriola socialism. Intellectualism, instead, is a partial development, an alloy of sociological liberalism, of the original socialism which was really nothing but the manifesto of a class. Ferri, for example, seems a more intellectual and capable person than Labriola. But the latter contends that interest in psychiatry and criminology and literature and religion are beside the question. He wishes to hasten directly the emergence of the proletariat. And to do this he would include in his ranks Catholics and Jews, liberals and conservatives. We were speculating one day at Barcola how much was spent in military and naval defence by England. The revenue income is £141,000,000–0–0 and the amount spent on army and navy is 66 millions: 47%. The revenue of Italy is 1700 million lire and of this 400 millions is spent on army and navy: 23%. England however has a vast territory to protect and, at least, possesses a powerful empire. Italy against the outlay of J of her revenue has an impoverished illiterate population, medieval sanitation, a terrible accumulation of taxes, and an army and navy which would probably fetch a few hundred pounds in a lottery. Of course, all this money does not go into the warchest. Japan, the first naval power in the world, I presume, in point of efficiency, spends three million pounds per annum on her fleet. Italy spends more than twice as much. Do you think there would be any use in my writing to Charlie? I wanted him to make some inquiries for me. What is their address? I wrote to A.J. at 4 Northbrook &c—was that right? A letter from Soc. of Authors this morning saying they have to consider the claims of older members &c &c. I am waiting to hear from Symons! I want an English dictionary badly. I don’t know how I could correct proofs at present. Georgie is very well and fat. He spends his day pulling about papers clothes and shoes. He is cursed frequently by both his parents for mislaying the comb and the sponge or the towel or my hat or shoes: and when asked where it is he points to the ceiling or the window and says ‘là!’The other evg l began to talk to Nora about something serious(!!!): but he wouldn’t allow it. He made such a noise that we had to stop and talk to him. His latest phrases are ‘Bua! (brucia!)’ ‘Lalia! (Giornale d’Italia)’ ‘Abace! (In braccia)’ and ‘Ata! (In terra).’ The two last he alternates very frequently. He also says ‘Appetito!’ and ‘Addio!’ The papers I put aside for you he usually tears up. I shall let you know in a few days how we are getting on with our new arrangement. Do you ever read the Daily Mail. A fellow named Edgar Wallace writes in it sometimes a farcical column: it is very funny. I am labouring at the end of Demos. Gissing’s effort to be just to his socialist protagonist is very distressing. I read that a Dublin solicitor was found poisoned in London when he was about to be struck off the rolls. The bottle bore the label Starkie’s Medical Hall. No wonder, begod, if it was as bad as his verses. I wish someone was here to talk to me about Dublin. I forget half the things I wanted to do. The two worst stories are After the Race and A Painful Case. When I have done reading the authors I said do you think I ought to read the Russians seriously or the Danish writers? Write a long letter. Jim Another purgative on Friday cost me L1.–! The box of pills cost 80c–! Viva l’Italia! Avanti Savoia!",
