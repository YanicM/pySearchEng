  "text": "Dear Curran: I hope the case of wine I have sent you from Avignon—a dozen of Clos S. Patrice, 1920, rouge—will arrive safely. I told Antoine Establet who owns the Clos to prepay the duty. The lees are shaken up in the voyage and the wine should stand about 3 weeks in a tempered room. I never drink it myself as I dislike red wine but it is really ‘wine from the royal pope’. The vineyard is at Châteauneuf du Pape, the oldest in that part of France, and Establet who inherited it says that before the sojourn of the popes at Avignon the wine of the country was known as vin de S. Patrice. I never met a fellow-islander who had heard of it but I mentioned it to Count O’Kelly, the I.F.S. envoy here, and to Dulanty in London and they said they would get it for dinners etc. There is another S. Patrice below Tours but it is only a vin de pichet. I hope your operation this year was a slight affair as your daughter said, and above all that it was successful. I would have written to you long ago but I have had two exceptionally trying years also on account of the U.S. suit which, after a 13 years’ struggle, I have won. I shall send you the N.Y. edition which gives the judge’s ruling almost in full. Thus one half of the English speaking world surrenders. The other half will follow….",
