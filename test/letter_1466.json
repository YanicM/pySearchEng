  "text": "Dear Curran: This is to tell you your photograph appears in Gorman’s life of me the first copies of which have now reached Paris, and I suppose, London from New York. The publishers are Farrar and Rinehart. I hope you and your family are well. Mine has been stricken by a new disaster. My unfortunate daughter-in-law has lost her reason and is at present internée d’office which is provisional certificate of lunacy. I had to rush up from La Baule where I was with Lucia (who is still ill but quieter) to Paris four months ago and we have had a dreadful time…. The flat in Villa Scheffer and the country house she intended to call Shillelagh are vacant and Giorgio is living with Léon’s brother-in-law. They say she may recover as the attack was so sudden and violent and slow cases are worse. She staged a marvellous banquet for my last birthday and read the closing pages on the passing-out of Anna Livia—to a seemingly much affected audience. Alas, if you ever read them you will see that they were unconsciously prophetical! I am and have been much affected by all this [word omitted]. While I am writing the little golden book with the title and date and names she had made for that day attached to my fountainpen keeps on tinkling. (Giorgio has had a hard experience. He had practically to kidnap the child en-pleine rue. I have had to take him in charge and put him in Mme Jolas’s school here.—We are staying here for the moment Giorgio and Becket are coming down for the boy’s birthday—15th—. I wrote to Lucia explaining the whole case. She said we could stay here and go back to her later on.) Ahimè! I have received a number of foreign notices of my book, Italian, Spanish, American. The best is by a Russian American—a professor at Harvard—and the most curious comes from Helsinki where, as was predicted, the Finn again wakes. Mrs J.F. Byrne writes to me from N.Y. asking me to approach publishers about a book (she says it is an epoch-making work) he has written. I asked you if you had noticed anything about him the last time he was in Europe. I wonder if your daughter met him when she was in the U.S. I feel there is something not all right there. All the same I will do what I can, not very much. With kind remembrances to Mrs and Miss Curran and yourself sincerely yours James Joyce",
