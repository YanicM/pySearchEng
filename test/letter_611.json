  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I am writing to Mr Quinn in the way I outlined in my letter to you and am glad that you agree with my view. May I trouble you to send me a copy of my novel which I need in order to present it to the actor who says that he is going to produce Exiles? Europe will soon be full of complimentary copies presented by me, or rather by you, to persons who perhaps will never read them. I enclose a notice of Ulysses from the New York Dial which the editor of the review forwarded me. With many kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
