  "text": "My dear Mr Healy: We came back here a week ago driven out of Holland by cyclones in the north and those impressive exhibitions of celestial intemperance known as thunderstorms…. Otherwise we had a pleasant time in Holland. They have reduced work to a minimum there. They seem to be simple, polite and dignified folk. Well set up men and girls and women who laughed all the time, though perhaps my presence there explains their mirth. To see 600 of them in a Square eating silvery raw herrings by moonlight is a sight for Rembrandt. They put drugs from their Indies into everything—cinnamon in cauliflower, spice in spinach, curry which they call kerry—in the gravy and give you ginger and cheese (very good) as soon as they think you have your mouth open. That dialect I spoke of, I think, is called Shelta. I fancy it is some corrupt Irish written backwards and used by gentlemen who don’t pay the rent. I hope you are keeping well. The clerk of the weather must be a student of Shelta too for seemingly he reads the word summer backwards…. I get about fifty denunciations a week of my new work from all parts of the English-as-she-is-speaking world including Australia. I shall try to go away in August. I would like to go to Denmark but it’s a long, long way to Copenhagen and the fare’s right dear.",
