  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Yabc came back typed and Yd will be here on Sunday or Monday. To what address can I send them and is the post safe? I have also to send you Gens de Dublin. The German version of APOTAAAYM seems to have gone astray. I sent it to you before the Spanish one. I wish you would read through Yabcd and tell me how they interact. Wyndham Lewis rang me up twice last week. I arranged to meet him at the clinic and we went to a café. He told me he wanted to meet me because he is to bring out a critical review (6 times yearly) The Tyrocritic (I hope he will correct the misspelling). It is to be all critical and philosophic and contain no creative work. But he wanted to make an exception in my case and asked me would I give him something. I said I would with great pleasure. I will tell you more about the interview when we next meet. I was much upset that day. My wife and I had a taxi collision an hour before. The front window at my side was smashed and the flying glass cut a neat design round my umbrella. I was unhurt. If I have not filled in a gap in the typescript before sending it it means that I could not think of the question to insert there. It has bothered me for some time. I have the book now fairly well planned out in my head. I am as yet uncertain whether I shall start on the twilight games of Z, Y and V which will follow immediately after U or on K’s orisons, to follow Yd. But my mind is rather exhausted for the moment. Have you read Saint Patrice? There is a book on Bruno (though not on Nolan) by Lewis McIntyre (Macmillan). I do not know if Vico has been translated. I would not pay overmuch attention to these theories, beyond using them for all they are worth, but they have gradually forced themselves on me through circumstances of my own life. I wonder where Vico got his fear of thunderstorms. It is almost unknown to the male Italians I have met.",
