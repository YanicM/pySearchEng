  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: If Messrs Duckworth have not yet replied I think you might press them for an answer. Mr Pound writes that a French friend of his has read the book, likes it and will interest herself about it. I understand that she is the niece of a French premier and a person of influence. He writes also that Mr Laurie has asked for it and also Mr Lane. If you decide to submit it to them will you ask them to give an undertaking to let you know their decision within three weeks? That period is sufficient since their reader has printed copy and not MS or typescript to read.",
