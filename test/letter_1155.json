  "text": "Dear Mr Morley: You probably saw my correspondence with Eliot about my daughter’s lettrines some months ago. I am giving you a Paris notice and a prospectus—this latter, simply as information. Only one copy of the book is to be seen in London as the British Customs at Newhaven seized all the copies sold to English buyers—10—and demanded Chinese ransom at the rate of £4 per book, the book costing already about £12. If you call at Bumpus’s shop in Oxford Street (?) you can get the lettrines and if they interest you I have a proposal to make with regard to my daughter’s work. Please let me hear from you as soon as you can. I shall write to you about myself shortly. I have been through a most trying time for the past year and especially the past half year. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
