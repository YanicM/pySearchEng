  "text": "Dear Stannie, Yes, allright. I will arrange for £10 a quarter to be sent to Eileen in Dublin from the time she arrives. As regards the rest of 6000 lire, you will have to use it, I am afraid. I have no money at present. In fact, I got a loan off my April cheque to send that. My income is £18 a week, not quite £1000 a year. My books between New York and London bring me in about £60 extra. Ulysses sold well there last five years, but Roth has killed the sales here, too, and has (or will) pocket the proceeds of 25 normal editions. Not a single daily or weekly in U.S. published our cabled denial. I am engaged in a very costly law suit, but will go on even if I lose it. I have organised an international protest to make this a test case for the reform of U.S. law. Please ask Benco to sign enclosed (incomplete) lists and return to 12 rue de l’Odeon as soon as possible. I wish he could get a few other good signatures: Praga, Bracco, Panzini. We cannot lose time. If Roth carries this through, the pirates in America will make it the beginning of even worse. Will you please send me Lecky and Kettle’s two books? I hope things are better now. Jim",
