  "text": "Dear Mr Hertz: Perhaps before I come you may be able to find out if there are vacancies in any schools of S. Gallen and whether, in general, a permit of residence in the canton can be had for this type of work anyhow. My brother was in correspondence with some school there. He has a certain claim of preference, I think, in case there is. His wife is from S. Gallen. The family name is Wirier Lichtensteiger and her father who was born there comes of an old S. Gallen family. Her uncle Paul Birnenstibel lives there still, I believe. Looking forward to the pleasure of seeing you and with thanks in advance sincerely yours James Joyce",
