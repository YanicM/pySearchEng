  "text": "Dear Budgen: The other M.O. went astray. Tant pis. Here is one to settle your outlay with thanks and hopes for its safe arrival. I suppose Ruggiero will write to you. I met Cendrars in the studio of Fernand Léger. Matisse, by the way, has been engaged by a N.Y. Book Club which is bringing out for subscribers an edition de luxe of Ulysses to do 20 illustrations. What do you think of this? I hope your book sells off so that they may do a cheaper edition soon. People tell you your book is so interesting, they must read it etc. and then they don’t buy it. It is useless. I have a grocer’s assistant’s mind. Friendly greetings sincerely yours James Joyce",
