  "text": "Dear Wallace Thanks for your kind note. Am writing this beside the window with half an eye. Have got leave to start for London on Thursday but am not yet cured. The nebula in the pupil will take some time yet to disappear. There have been other reviews of Ulysses but I can’t send them as they are packed up in cases and stored. I am glad to hear you are living so well and so cheaply there. The German motto ought to be—’tis better to have fought and lost than never to have won at all. I have to stay in London for a week or perhaps two in order to do some business with various people and then I shall go somewhere if put into a train. 1000 drops of stuff in my eye, profuse nightly perspirations and pain have made me for the moment very fatigued and irritable so that if there is any undue noise or confusion travelling I shall get out of the train and sit or lie on the rails. I would enjoy indeed a bottle of Rüdesheimer with you. May it greatly increase your tranquil serenity but in case of bad dreams resulting therefrom you can turn Hindenburg’s face to the wall. Please excuse this ill written letter. I hope you will continue to enjoy yourselves. My kindest remembrances to you both James Joyce [Enclosure] Turf Rue de l’Université Dearest Lilian: I hope you are having a good time. Are you getting fat? We are off on Thursday am fed up with Paris rotten weather everything dull since you left. I am sorry we could not have gone on to Germany. However I hope we shall soon meet again. I will write to you from London with best love to you both from us Irish Nora",
