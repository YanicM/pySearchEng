  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: Your letter came just as we were leaving Paris for here. Thanks for settling that bill and many thanks for again offering us your villa for the summer. But we are taking only a short holiday. I have at last rented an empty flat and as soon as the workmen have finished in it we have to go back to start moving in. This would be a charming place here but for the rain which we brought with us, it seems. Anyhow, I hope you both enjoy your holiday. I am tired of the summer before it begins. After a very long delay Mr Pulver sent back Luciaâ€™s letters, saying that pressure of work prevented him from giving an opinion on the handwriting of the person in question. Taking this with what you told me I think it not unlikely that he has a strong suspicion who it is. If then he does not want to give an opinion it may be because he resents having been approached in such a veiled way or because what he has to say is too unpleasant for him to write. The news we have about her is slightly better but it is all very slow and confused. They really know as much about these cases as the layman. Our address in Paris, as from the 15 September, will be: 7 rue Edmond Valentin Paris VII Our kind regards to both Mr Giedion and yourself Sincerely yours James Joyce",
