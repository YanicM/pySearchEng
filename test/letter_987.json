  "text": "Dear Larbaud: These few lines to tell you my wife was operated on the 8 and has had now a 7 days radium treatment. All has gone well up to the present. We go home in a day or so and then, after 15 days autovaccine treatment return here for 4 days more radium. This ought to effect a definite cure. It has been a dreadful fortnight for all of us, however. As regards myself I can see my own handwriting in this black graphite but cannot see one word of any print but capitals! I think you have not heard the ‘préhistoire’ to E.M.’s article. He is not ‘against us’ naturally but feeling is too raw in Italian literary circles to make our intervention at present advisable. Du reste, qui s’excuse, s’accuse. Thanks for your kind inquiries also from my wife. Pardon this MS. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
