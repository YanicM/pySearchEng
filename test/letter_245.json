I expected to have had some remittance from you after the first as agreed. I have laid in a good stock of clothes and of the money forwarded by Machnich a good part will go to keep up this house. How are you. For God’s sake don’t go about without an overcoat. Will I send you heavy stuff for one? I send you another story by Stephens. Tell me if they are good. Fusees no go. Got agency for stuffs and sent Steiner 100 samples. Call to help him. Urge M to come Jim",
