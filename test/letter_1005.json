  "text": "Dear Larbaud: It is useless to begin an account of the half year and more I had of worry, expense and nerves in Paris. Our three visits to Hospital etc. It is all over I hope and well over, but I could not fix my mind to write. And then, I had to work literally night and day on Shem and Shaun and then I left, and here in Torquay, not seeing well I fell over a wall a week or so ago and even yet sleep badly from the pain of my arm. Moreover though I can read with some difficulty, my sight is much worse than it was etc. etc. Anyhow we hope Mrs Nebbia and yourself have the opposite story to tell. We return to Paris sometime in September and I ought to go to see an oculist in Barcelona before Christmas, Borsch of Paris being dead. And do tell me when, where and how we are likely to meet for it becomes everyday more impossible to discuss me and what I am trying to do by letter. First the small news, the French press on Ulysses was much better than the German and A.M. hopes to arrange for an ordinary edition in January. I suppose you heard about the commemoration lunch, yourself, Morel and Gilbert being absent however. I was with Morel the night before at the theatre and until one o’clock at Weber’s and he promised me he would come but then sent me a telegram saying he had to meet his pupil at a station between Paris and Vannes. I know this was true but he could have come by straining a point. He is not well, has to undergo operations on both legs, lest he become suddenly immobilised and talks of retiring to his island in the Pacific Ocean! It is all rather regrettable don’t you think? He is rather sauvage but if he had come it would perhaps have given him some satisfaction. Gide and Jaloux couldn’t come but Dujardin, Valéry, Soupault and Romains were there. And L.P.F. was beside me. By the way he spoke to me somewhat wistfully about you, asking me when I heard from you and so on and gave me to understand that though you were still estranged, your public utterances concerning him and his writing were untroubled and serenely appreciative. Of which appreciation he expressed his appreciation. Valéry and he wanted to make speeches but I put a veto on that. There were no English or Americans except the kind lady who is typing this. But there were two riotous young Irishmen and one of them fell deeply under the influence of beer, wine spirits, liqueurs, fresh air, movement and feminine society and was ingloriously abandoned by the Wagonette in one of those temporary palaces which are inseparably associated with the memory of the Emperor Vespasian. Before I go on, Gilbert has an article in the current Fortnightly—one of the chapters of his book on my Ulysses—Hades, and he wants to place another in French in a Paris review, not the Revue de Paris. The chapter being that on the Wandering Rocks. Can you suggest which Review, or do you know anyone in the Revue de France for example? A third chapter will appear in October Transition, Aeolus, and a fourth he wants to place in an American or Italian monthly of the same standing. The whole book has an introduction and eighteen chapters and it ought to come out in English in the late autumn or spring if T.S. Elliot [sic] who asked to be allowed to read it for the publisher Faber and Gwyer (the Criterion) accepts it. What you say about the Exag is right enough. I did stand behind those twelve Marshals more or less directing them what lines of research to follow. But up to the present though at least a hundred copies have been freely circulated to the press and pressmen not a single criticism has appeared. My impression is that the paper cover, the grandfather’s clock on the title page and the word Exagmination itself for instance incline reviewers to regard it as a joke, though these were all my doing, but some fine morning not a hundred years from now some enterprising fellow will discover the etymological history of the orthodox word examination and begin to change his wavering mind on the subject of the book, whereupon one by one others will faintly echo in the wailful choir, ‘Siccom e i gru van cantando lor lai.’ I hope you got T.T. of S. and S. and liked the edition. What do you think of Ogden’s preface and Brancusi’s whirligig. From your silence I fancy that at least you find it difficult. It is, and it would be childish to deny it, but I am sending you by the next post a curious book which may or may not look to you like English at first sight and it does not come from any Black Sun Magical press outside England as she is spoken, nor is it written by an escaped continentalized Dubliner inflicted with the incurable levity of youth. It is written by the right honorable Robert Bridges, Poet Laureate to His Majesty the King, English, now aged three score and ten (I mean R.B.) and issued from Oxford where they make the best shirts. It seems to me that it would be interesting to that imaginary Reader let us call him, the Good Terrafirmaite equally at home in Potsdam, Sacré Coeur, Maladetta and whatever is the Portuguese for Devil take the hindmost to read in the most affable of all tongues, because the most accessible, some recording by you of this curious meeting of extremes. What do you think about it? I wish I had some leisure and that both our minds were free from preoccupation to discuss with you about it. So that I hope we shall soon meet in Paris. I feel that Fargue would be interested in the conversation for his mind has been running fairly constantly in the same direction now for some years but there is in his case the almost fatal objection that he is a man of one language only, though perhaps one could discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this for all eternity. Anyhow I am now hopelessly with the goats and can only think and write capriciously. Depart from me ye bleaters, into everlasting sleep which was prepared for Academicians and their agues! With kind regards and looking forward as well as backward to the last and next bottles of Vouvray Moncontour … Lord, send us both the green coat and cocked hat! Amen.",
