  "text": "My dear little Butterfly I got your letter this evening and am glad you like that photograph of your unworthy lover taken in all his warpaint. I hope you got my little present of gloves safely. I sent them just as I sent you my first present five years ago—from the ‘Ship.’ The nicest pair is that one of reindeer skin: it is lined with its own skin, simply turned inside out and should be warm, nearly as warm as certain districts of your body, Butterfly. Twelve yards (not eleven as I wrote) of tweed were sent you from Donegal. I would like the coat of your dress to reach nearly the base of the skirt and to be collared, belted and cuffed with dark blue leather and lined with bronze or dark blue satin. If this affair comes off and I am continued beyond the fifth of November and receive fresh money I hope to send you a splendid set of furs which I am selecting specially. They are grey squirrel. There would be a grey squirrel cap with violets at the side and a long broad flat stole of grey squirrel and a beige granny muff of the same on a steel chain, both lined with violet satin. Would you like that, dear? I hope I may be able to get it for you. I am also getting ready a special Xmas present for you. I have bought specially cut sheets of parchment and am copying out on them all my book of verses in indelible Indian ink. Then I will get them bound in a curious way I like myself and this book will last hundreds of years. I will burn all the other MSS of my verses and you will then have the only one in existence. It is very hard to copy on parchment but I work at it hoping it will give pleasure to the woman I love. It is two o’clock at night. I have been copying here alone in the kitchen since they all went to bed and now I am writing to you. I wish I could look up and encounter those dog’s eyes of yours. I will try to deserve the trust they have in me. Do not fret, little Butterfly. Here are a few lines of verse written four hundred years ago by a poet who was a friend of Shakespeare’s: Tears kill the heart, believe. O strive not to be excellent in woe Which only breeds your beauty’s overthrow. You are a sad little person and I am a devillishly melancholy fellow myself so that ours is a rather mournful love I fancy. Do not cry about that tiresome young gentleman in the photograph. He is not worth it, dear. It is very good of you to enquire about that damned dirty affair of mine. It is no worse anyhow. I was alarmed at your silence first. I feared you had something wrong. But you are all right, are you not, dearest? Thank God! Poor little Nora, how bad I am to you! Never mind Eva but you might see that Stannie looks after himself. I hope he is better now. Addio, Giorgino e Lucetta! Vengo subito! And addio, Nora mia! Jim",
