  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks indeed for your kind letter. I enclose one of a different tenor. Its weatherbeaten appearance shows the energy with which I put it into my pocket. We have been here for nine months and I am only one week in arrears…. This Norwegian must have been reading my MS surruptiously [sic], I fear. Mr Tuohy has added still another complication by insisting on remaining another week. I have now given him 26 sittings. He was to have left today but last night he begged for two more and as he is forfeiting his salary as professor at the Dublin school of art I consented. He will telegraph to you when he arrives in London and bring you the portrait. He has to get a special cage made as the paint will not be dry. I am to see Dr Borsch at 6 p.m. and will add a postscript to this to tell you what is decided about the operation. The posing has tired me but I think it would be well to go into the clinic and have it over. There are so many problems to be solved that I can face only one at a time. Perhaps in there staring up at darkness I may solve the second. Does Mr Huebsch’s account mean that no copy of my novel was sold in the United States in one year and that my total royalties come to 30 $. I have written to a friend of mine, a Mr Fleischman, formerly a partner in the firm Boni and Liveright, to try to take the books off Mr Huebsch’s hands. They are not even in his catalogue, Miss Beach says, and yet copies of the Transatlantic Review with Mamalujo in it fetch 18 $.50, visitors report. The weather is dreadful today and ‘my sight is growing thicker on me with the shadows in this place’. My memory too is dulled. I cannot remember accurately the first page of Shaun and he is not here to aid me. I revised the new press cuttings for Miss Beach. I hope you received the Nouvelles Littéraires. Mr Larbaud has great courage. On the same page you will see a notice about Commerce in which a translation of the first 12 pages of Ithaca as far as ‘Old Ollebo M.P.’ will appear. I expect a letter from the solicitors in the morning and I shall then write to them and to you. In the meantime it is useless for me to say anything but that if I had been in your place and in my present mood I would have thrown the fire irons (including the fender) at the spectral bore seated in that armchair. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. The operation, Dr Borsch says, ought to be done. He cannot do it on Wednesday as Mr Tuohy wants that day. It will be made on Saturday. J.J.",
