  "text": "Dear Sir: Many thanks indeed for your very kind letter and I am glad to hear that you hope to be able to include my play Exiles in your programme. I am writing to my agent, Mr James Pinker, Talbot House, Arundel Street, Strand, London W C 1. to send on at once a typescript. If he has not one he will ask my publisher Mr Grant Richards to have a full proof pulled. I do not know whether the play has been published or not yet. As soon as you have received it and have definite news as to approximate date of production may I ask you to let me know? I should be very glad indeed to accept your suggestion of attending rehearsals in London and hope circumstances may concur to that end. I am trying to recover some of my lost health in this good climate here. As you are so kind to mention my novel I am taking the liberty of enclosing some English and American notices which are amusingly contradictory. I am very much obliged to you for your very friendly and effective interest in my writings and beg you to believe me sincerely yours, James Joyce",
