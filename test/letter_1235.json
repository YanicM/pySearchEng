  "text": "(Il ragazzo dai cappelli tagliati, il giovine tosato, nomignolo dato ai giovini ribelli irlandesi nel 1798 (Ninety Eight) dalla guarnigione inglesi [sic]) Good men and true in this house who dwell To a country bouchel (boy) I pray you tell Is the priest at home and can he be seen I would speak a word with Father Breen, The priest’s at home and he may be seen Tis aisy talking with Father Breen So just step inside until I see If the holy father alone may be. The youth has entered a lonely hall What a solemn sound makes his low footfall And the gloomy chamber is chill and bare With a vested priest in an oaken chair. The youth has knelt and confessed his sins In nomine Dei the youth begins And at mea culpa he beats his breast And in broken murmurs confesses the rest. I cursed three times since last Easter Day And at masstime once I went to play I passed the churchyard one day in haste And forgot to pray for my mother’s rest. I bear no hate to a living thing But I love my country beyond the King So bless me, father, and let me go To die, if God has ordered it so. The priest said nought but a rustling noise Made the youth look up in wild surprise And before his eyes there sat in the chair A yeoman captain with fiery glare. With fiery glare and with fury hoarse Instead of a blessing he breathed a curse ’Twas a good thought boy to come here and shrive For one short hour is your time to live. On yonder river two tenders float The priest’s in one if he isn’t shot I hold this house for my lord the King And Amen, say I, may all traitors swing! At Geneva barracks that young man died And at Passage they have his body laid. Good people, who hear this in peace and joy, Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, for the Croppy Boy. (Questa canzone era il il cavallo da battaglia del grande basso leggiero irlandese William Ludwig. La generazione attuale l’ignora. È un nobile e semplice poema musicale, profondamente sincero e dramatico. Bisogna, quando lo canti, tenere il bilancio egualmente fra il capitano ed il giovine. L’ultima strofe si canta su un tono solenne ed impersonale. L’effetto di questra strofe, resa da una voce come la tua, è eletrizzante [sic]. Altro che I Due Granatieri e La Canzone del Volga! Non è una canzone patriottica come Wearing of the Green. Potresti cantarlo a Sheffield come a Cork. Studia ogni parola e ne farai un capolavoro) A ḃuacailin sluinn, eiḃin, óg (a voocalin aulin eevin oge O young lad, pretty, pleasant, young) bad leatan do cɼoiḋe, bad ḋeaſ do ṗóg (broad was thy heart, sweet thy kiss, bodh lahan dho creeye, bodh dhyas dho pogue) (These two lines are enough for Colm to tell you the rest. Aggiungo le parole inglesi. Ci sono decine di varie versioni di questa canzone) I’ll dye my petticoats I’ll dye them red And round this wide world I’ll search my bread Till friends and foes will think me dead Iſ go déiṫ tu mo muiɼnín ſlean I wish I were on yonder hill ’Tis there I’d sit and cry my fill Till every tear would turn a mill I wish I wish I wish in vain I wish I had my heart again And vainly think I’d not complain. Phonetic Shule shule shule aroon Shule go siukar ogars shule go kewn Mo lane gou misha ogus elya lyum Is go dikey thoo mawoorneen slawn. As I was going the road one fine day, (O the brown and the yellow ale!) I met with a man that was no right man (O love of my heart!) He asked was the woman with me my daughter (O the brown etc) And I said that she was my married wife (O, love etc) He asked would I lend her for an hour and a day And I said I would do anything that was fair. So let you take the upper road and I’ll take the lower And we’ll meet again at the ford of the river. I was walking that way one hour and three quarters When she came to me without shame. When I heard her news I lay down and I died And they sent two men to the wood for timber. A board of holly and a board of alder And two great yards of sack about me. And but that my own little mother was a woman I could tell you another pretty story about women PS. Farò copiare la musica di queste tre canzone quanto prima. Ti abbraccio Babbo Vigilia di Ceppo 1934 Z’ch 5 ore del pomeriggio e tutti i negozi chiusi!!!!",
