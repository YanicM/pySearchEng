  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Did you get the MS and typescript sent you a week or so ago? I am sending you more enclosed, also the pages to replace the faulty ones. The passage ‘Let us now … Shem the penman’ follows the words ‘the hen saw’. Between the words ‘penman’ and ‘Revered’ are three further passages, a description of Shem-Ham-Cain-Egan etc and his penmanship, Anna Livia’s visits and collaboration and delivery of the memorial by Shawn the post. I finished the calligraphy expertise a day or two ago but have felt so tired since that I have scarcely energy enough to hold a pen. The MS of Ulysses is to be sold today in New York. I expect Mr Quinn will cable me. The pound was 98.25 yesterday in Paris and the dollar 22.40! The Blooms of the Bourse are very thoughtful. I hope you are in good health and enjoying a quiet holiday. The first caricature of Ulysses I saw appeared in a comic Dublin paper Dublin Opinion. A convict has called the warder. The warder says ‘We let you off hard labour and gave you Joyce’s Ulysses to read. What do you want now?’ The convict (handing back a large volume): More oakum!",
