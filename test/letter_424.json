  "text": "Dear Mrs Kettle: I have read this morning, with deep regret in the Times that my old school fellow and fellow student Lieutenant Kettle has been killed in action. I hope you will not deem it a strangerâ€™s intrusion on your grief to accept from me a word of sincere condolence. I remember very gratefully his benevolent and courteous friendliness to me when I was in Ireland seven years ago. May I ask you also to convey to your sisters (whose addresses I do not know) my sympathy with them in the losses they have suffered. I am grieved to learn that so many misfortunes have fallen on your family in these evil days.",
