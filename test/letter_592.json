  "text": "Dear Mr Linati: Thanks for the Convegno. I had a letter also from Dr Ferrieri and wrote to my friend the poet Rodker, director of the Little Review (some of whose verses I am enclosing as they may perhaps be suitable for the review Poesia) and hope he will write the desired article. I shall not write to Dr Ferrieri before getting your reply. Pound seems most satisfied with the essay sent to him. I am working like a galley-slave, an ass, a brute. I cannot even sleep. The episode of Circe has changed me too into an animal. Luckily the hero had not more than twelve adventures. Write when you hear about some enterprising producer.",
