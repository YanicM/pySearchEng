It will appear next March. Eva will come back with me. Raise all you can and send. A camp bed will do her for the first month and she can sleep with Georgie in the room you occupy. There will be no professorship of Italian in the New National University (I went to the secretary) only a lectureship to mixed evg classes in commercial Italian. £100. a year. No literature or philology. Am applying for examinership when I get testimonials needed. Have written to Synge’s executors: no reply. Jim",
