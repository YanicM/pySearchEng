  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: … I have received a copy of the Spanish translation of A.P.O.T.A.A.A.Y.M. and also of the German version. Would you care to have these, the German at least? Mr Rascher admits to having sold 9 copies of Verbannte and wants a million…. I finished the revision of Yabcd yesterday. Today I copied out the sheets of Ya which were unreadable to have them retyped. Tomorrow and Monday I shall do, I hope, the same for Yb. Then Yc will take three or four days. Then the typing of these and the ‘man of four watches’ is complete. I am not sure for the moment how much I have done. I shall know when I read it. I am to read it Yab, interval, and Yc to a small group, this time including Antheil and a young American Galantière who is preparing a course of lectures on U. I think I have done a good deal. My brother says that having done the longest day in literature I am now conjuring up the darkest night. I will send you Yd complete in typescript and the necessary new pages to insert into Yabc. Have you read Le Culte des Héros yet? What do you think of it? Every time I read a piece I go round with the hat after begging those present to remember it and help me by finding things for me. They all seem to forget about it as quickly as possible except Miss Beach who knows how to whistle books out of the air. How long do you stay in London? I hope your sister goes on well. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
