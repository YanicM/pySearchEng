Honoré Paris Lucia is summering at Feldkirch with some friends, Hotel zum Loewen. I am here about my eyes. Their state is aggravated owing to my delay in coming, due to one damn worry after another. In fact Vogt fears the eye he could have perhaps saved 20 months ago must go blind. However, I am under observation. Best regards to Nelly and yourself Jim P.S. Giorgio is at La Ferme du May S. Jean-Cap Ferrat Alpes Maritimes France.",
