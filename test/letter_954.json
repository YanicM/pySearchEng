But in that case I shall not call on the person in question till tomorrow (Saturday) so that there may seem to be no connection between our two visits. I shall call about another matter and introduce the principal theme casually but firmly. After which I shall write you to fix an appointment. It will be all right, I am sure. So donâ€™t worry. Sincerely yours J.J.",
