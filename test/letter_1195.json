  "text": "Dear Lucia: Mamma has dispatched to you today some articles of clothing. As soon as the list of what you want comes we will send off the things immediately. There was no list in the letter of the 29 ult. As to the typewriter, it would be a huge expense, about 4000 francs. There is one here in the house and I gather from Dr Forel’s last letter, which gave me great joy, that your sojourn on the pleasant shores of the lake of Geneva will not be too much prolonged now. (The devil take the summer! The heat clouds my spectacles and I see with difficulty what I write!) But you could hire a machine. At Geneva certainly you would find one. Something is always lacking in my royal palace. Today is the turn of ink. I send you the programme of the Indian dancer Uday Shankar. If he ever performs at Geneva don’t miss going there. He leaves the best of the Russians far behind. I have never seen anything like it. He moves on the stage floor like a semi-divine being. Altogether, believe me, there are still some beautiful things in this poor old world. I am glad that you are on good terms with that Dutch doctor but does it not seem to you that it would be rude on my part to write to him when I am in correspondence with doctors Forel and Humbert? But if he writes to me first then I could reply to him. (Saint Francis de Sales, protector of writers, pour a little ink into this inkstand!) Mamma is chattering on the telephone with the lady above who dances the one-step so well and fished my note of a thousand lire out of the lift. The subject of the conversation between them is the lady on the fifth floor who breeds dogs. These ‘friends of man’ hinder the lady on the fourth floor from meditating like the Buddha. Now they have finished with dogs and are speaking of me. I see great progress in your last letter but at the same time there is a sad note which we do not like. Why do you always sit at the window? No doubt it makes a pretty picture but a girl walking in the fields also makes a pretty picture. Write to us oftener. And let’s forget money troubles and black thoughts. Ti abbraccio, Father.",
