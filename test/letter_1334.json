As I have been carrying your other little book of poems for so many years round Europe perhaps you will do me the pleasure of inscribing it also? I enclose it in any case and thank you in advance. I hope you are well and weathering with your old amiable serenity these somewhat gusty times and indeed I thank you for your kind words about myself and reciprocate all your friendly remembrances Sincerely yours James Joyce",
