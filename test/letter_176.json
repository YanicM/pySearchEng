  "text": "Couldn’t write on Sunday. Got a translation to do, a hellish long thing about some new American game. It took me about 4 hours. I got five lire for it. Mathews has sent me a contract to sign: no royalty on 1st 300 copies then 15%. Price 1s/6d. Golden Treasury size, published this spring. I suppose I had better accept—and you can correct the proofs. From 8.30 in the morning until 7.30 in evening I do not get five minutes to myself. I never get out at 1 now. However I will write on Sunday without fail. Write you and advise. As for money I think I can reach the end of the month if you send 10 or 15 crowns. Can you do this? If so, send it in a registered sealed envelope to my address. Jim",
