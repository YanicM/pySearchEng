  "text": "Dear Mr Rodker: Many thanks indeed for the copy of Hymns so kindly sent me with the friendly signature. I have read your verses with much pleasure. A Mr Ivan Goll who is making an anthology of modern poets had the bad idea of coming to me for information. I gave him your name among others. A Milanese international review Poesia would publish, I am sure, some of your verses, for example, those on pp 20–21. If you consider it worthwhile doing so perhaps you could send me a typed copy of a poem. They published lately some verses by Mr Pound and by me. I have not received that copy of The Oxen of the Sun but perhaps you have read part of the Nausikaa episode. The best plan is to ask Miss Weaver to let you see these two episodes so that you may judge of their length. Please excuse me for my delay in acknowledging receipt of your book but I have been rather worried. With renewed thanks and kind regards from me to Mrs Rodker and yourself Sincerely yours James Joyce",
