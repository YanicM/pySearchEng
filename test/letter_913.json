  "text": "Dear Miss Marsden: Before I write trying to explain what I am doing and why I want the case of Pound’s soundness of judgment at the present moment more gone into. I am glad you agree about Dunning. Some time ago Mrs Symons asked me (from her husband) if I had not written any verse since Chamber Music and if it would collect. I said it would make a book half as big but I did not trust my opinion of it as I rarely thought of verse. There are about fifteen pieces in all, I think, and I suppose someone someday will collect them. I mentioned this to Pound and asked could I show him, say, two. I left them at his hotel. A few days after I met him and he handed me back the envelope but said nothing. I asked him what he thought of them and he said: They belong in the bible or the family album with the portraits. I asked: You don’t think they are worth reprinting at any time? He said: No, I don’t. Accordingly I did not write to Mrs Symons. It was only after having read Mr Dunning’s drivel which Pound defends as if it were Verlaine that I thought the affair over from another angle. They are old things but are they so bad that Rococo is better than their poorness?… Remember me to Miss Marsden. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
