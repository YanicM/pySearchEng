  "text": "Dear Huebsch: I regret we did not meet when I was up north, so near you. I got your Swedish address too late but in any case thank Mrs Huebsch and yourself for the kind invitation you extended to us. I hope you liked my daughterâ€™s lettrines for the Chaucer book. Herewith I send you the T.L.S with an advertisement which Faber and Faber have put in. I also send you another copy of the book. You will remember I gave you a copy of it in London already in 1931. Faber and Faber apparently bought over a good part of the Paris stock and rebound it, I suppose. I think its issue in the U.S. would be also advisable as I told you then. Ulysses should come out in London on 1 October. I hope you had a pleasant holiday, sincerely yours James Joyce",
