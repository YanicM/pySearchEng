  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards In reply to yours of 29 ult: I agree to the terms in our old contract but there are a few points on which it is better to be clear. Could you bring out the book in May? I undertake to return proofs sent me corrected within two days of receipt. I hope our troubles are now at an end and wish your house and myself and the ill-fated book good luck. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
