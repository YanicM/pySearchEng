  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I don’t think I am violating any confidence in enclosing V.L.’s new letter since you do not know what it is about though a good dozen of people, if he is right, do here. (What English!) But as you were, luckily for me, present at one heated scene I want you to know that it’s quite as warm as ever in Paris. I have, I think, smoothed over matters between V.L. and Her but there remain to be rubbed down S.G. (!) and A.M., the two translators who dislike each other and V.L. and are heartily disliked by him in return. Fortunately (??) they all like ME. Ahem! Pound has agreed to give evidence against Roth. Ford has invited me to be godfather to his daughter (see Shaun’s sermon) who is to be baptised a R.C. on Friday next. Svevo has sent me Veruda’s portrait of his redheaded wife, Mrs S. (v. Anna Livia: her name is Livia S.). Mrs Jolas is going to U.S.A. Elliot Paul is married. Mr and Mrs Sage are divorced etc. The transition people are beginning to bother me again for the June instalment but I have not energy enough to say yes, aye or no. I have lost pounds and pounds of flesh. Weigh 8 st. odd which is nothing for one who would be a sixfooter if mangled out so I have to eat oyster, Turkish Delight, Butter Scotch, coal, strychnine, hypophosphates etc etc. Rodker came over. He wanted to publish Pt I and then do a version of A.L.P. which I could not sanction. Now he wants to do a similar bit from Pt III with a preface, as I suggested, by a 100% Englishman. I have not agreed to anything yet as I shall have to talk it over with Miss Beach first. Antheil is gone—to work in the Cyclops’ forge, I suppose. I am not very well. Dieppe was too damp and I have sharp recurrences of pains. The doctor examined me, says I have no inflammation worth talking about but am nervously exhausted. I shall try to get away to ‘Tristan da Cunha’ as soon as I can. But there is a great difference in the state of my mind since your visit so the spasms are only physical. As it is Oyster Monday I shall now close up my shell for the evening. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce P.S. Please send back V.L.’s letter.",
