  "text": "Dear Stannie: I had a letter yesterday from Miss Weaver, saying that she has made me a further gift of £2000 (two thousand). Will send you particulars later. Will you ask Frank to telephone to those sons of bitches at the Adriatica (the man’s name is Bruna) who have bungled the sending of my case of books which I gave them on the 30 June? I am much inconvenienced by their cursed mumchanciness. Giorgio has been offered a position here in an American Trust Agency which would develop into a secretaryship and travellership for same. The salary would be about 200 frs (French) a month to begin with. Lucia has become Napoleon-mad, a fact you may inform Sordina of. Quinn sent 3500 francs. Huebsch is crying off Ulysses. Miss Weaver writes nobody will print it. So it will be printed, it seems, in Paris and bear Mr John Rodker’s imprint as English printer. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis, Rodker and their wives keep moving between London, Paris and the country. Dinners and lunches are the order of the day. An admirer of mine, an American officer, presents me with an army overcoat. Budgen was here a week, gone to London. Also Mrs Sykes: and her husband is coming. What about Little Reviews etc? I enclose cutting of Lord French’s latest speech—delivered in Dublin. He has left Ireland which, being an Irishman, he refuses to annihilate. Sir Horace Rumbold, has been unanimously chosen as First Emperor of Ireland. Please hang the Union Jack out of the scullery window at the exact instant when he ascends his ancestral throne of alabaster. If a man named Buckley calls, asking to see His Majesty, he is on no account to be admitted. By Order James (Heb. Vat. Terg. Ex. Lut. Hosp. Litt. Angl. Pon. Max.) P.S. Ask Frank to ask that Hungarian in his bank the Magyar for Mr e.g. Mr Joseph Smith",
