  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: The report is all right, thank goodness, so that’s that. I finished pulling together the first 8 episodes last night and as I am quite fatigued and it is a splendid day Giorgio is taking us out for a long country drive…. To my great relief I find that much more of the book is done than I had hoped for. Soupault who has been on a lecture tour in the U.S.A. told me yesterday that the government would have no chance of winning a suit against Ulysses. He said it is on the extension lecture program for many universities and actually prescribed for the M.A. degree for next year in the New York university. So let them take off the ban and I suppose England will follow suit as usual a few years later. And Ireland 1000 years hence. May I ask you to put through two telephone calls before you leave London…. Please return Four to Léon. The writer should not have used O.G.’s letter in an article. The latter is a swimmer, boxer, cyclist, aviator, motorist and of course I cut a poor figure, eyeless etc. Still the world begins from an egg. Enough of them and all alien annoyances. I have a job on hand. Kindest regards sincerely yrs James Joyce",
