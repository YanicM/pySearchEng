  "text": "Dear Mrs Giedion: Thanks for your signed book and I was glad to see my old friend from Carnac in it. Also for the typed certificates of my brother. I sent copies of these to Dr Steinberg, Dr Speck and Prof. Fleiner. The latter wrote he could do nothing about the Fremdenpolizei until Dr Steinberg or some other employer took the first step. I have now received a letter from my brother, the sense of which I have just communicated to Dr Speck. If you ring her up she will tell you how the case now stands. In a word my brother has a quasi-certainty of obtaining permission for Zurich if an application is made for him by his employer. You will see by the Paris Italian paper I send that the Paris Italian colony has just been fÃªting me. It is opportune (and quite right) that this should happen just now. Nevertheless the horizon looks to me so dark that I would be very glad to hear that my brother has definitely settled in Switzerland. We have had a wretched Whitsuntide! Thank the Lord it is over! Kind regards to you both sincerely yours James Joyce",
