  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: I enclose contract signed by me. Kindly forward also to Mr Marshall a copy of ‘Dubliners’ and of the press notices of it which I sent you so that he may, if he wish, insert a leaflet of extracts in the edition of the novel. I give him, not Mr Huebsch, the right of refusal of ‘Dubliners’: therefore suspend all negotiations with the latter. The Egoist company could not find a printer in the United Kingdom to print my novel. They now intend to work in conjunction with Mr Marshall and use his printer. Mr Ezra Pound will call on you at my request in a few days. You can ask him for Mr Hackett’s address and withdraw the second copy as I know nothing of it. As you are aware it is Mr Pound who has arranged both the English and American editions of my novel Sincerely yours James Joyce",
