  "text": "Dear Sir: M. LaMallide, editor of La Vie des Peuples (a copy of which I send you for your guidance) asked me to obtain for him from a good source three articles on the following subjects. 1) The Irish novel today 2) The Irish theatre today 3) The Irish economic question He wishes to publish these articles at once in successive issues of his review. I have taken the liberty of forwarding the request to you as the recognized historian of the Irish literary movement in the hope that your engagements may allow you to accede to it. The articles should be in English and typed. They will be translated here. I do not know the scale of remuneration but, the franc being low and Paris review scales being low also, it will not be considerable. It might therefore repay you to forward your articles at the same time to Mr Ezra Pound, London editor of The Dial, for simultaneous publication in New York. The rates of The Dial are $5 a page for prose and $10 for verse. Possibly you will be able to find a competent person among your acquaintances for the economic article. This, I understand, in view of the general tone of the review should be expository and not polemical. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
