  "text": "Padua is full up of the overflowings of Venice. When I arrived I had to make a pilgrimage from door to door before I got a room. Consequently things are dearer. Today, I had to write my English theme—Dickens and saw my English examiner, an old, ugly spinster from the tight little island—a most dreadful fRump (reformed spelling). The orals and the trial lesson will not be fixed for some days. I cannot remain on another 5 or 6 days so that I shall probably return tomorrow and wait a telegram to come again for 1 day. That will cost 25 crowns but to remain on would cost more besides the disorder of the lessons in Trieste.",
