  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: A fortnight ago I sent you by registered post a set of proofs (receipt enclosed). Did you receive them safely? If so will you please send them back, preferably in two or three registered letters as printed matter often takes weeks to reach here. I have two new sets to send but should like to know that the first reached you. I have now finished the Ithaca episode and with that the writing of Ulysses. What remains to be done is the revision of proofs of the last four episodes. The printer says he can set it all by 15 November and bring it out, he hopes, by the end of the month. I intend to do nothing in the way of revision of proofs for two days as I feel very tired and listless. I shall begin again on Thursday and the fault will be the printer’s not mine if the book is not out in a few weeks. Those few weeks, however, are a trouble to me materially. About 400 subscriptions are made, I believe, but no part of the money will be available till the notices go out towards the end of the month to the effect that the book is ready. I should be glad to have these three weeks free in order to complete the revision of the last proofs. The landlord is already somewhat dubious I am afraid. I have scarcely energy enough to write more precisely but if there is any small amount forthcoming in the way of royalties I should be greatly relieved to have it by return. If I can get over these few weeks in peace I am quite willing to do any active work which society may assign me. A coincidence is that of birthdays in connection with my books. A Portrait of the Artist which first appeared serially in your paper on 2 February finished on 1 September. Ulysses began on 1 March (birthday of a friend of mine, a Cornish painter) and was finished on Mr Pound’s birthday, he tells me. I wonder on whose it will be published. I am sending this by airmail and, if not too much trouble for you, would be glad to have a line from you in reply. With kind regards and apologies for the somewhat fatigued and certainly boring contents of the present sincerely yours James Joyce",
