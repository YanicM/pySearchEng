  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards I am surprised to have had no word from you about my books. I am anxious to know what you have decided to do about them. You will easily understand my anxiety, I hope, and pardon any importunity. The English post from Vienna was destroyed by fire some few days ago. Is it possible that anything of mine suffered? I shall be glad if you will write to me before the 24th prox as on that date I leave this address and your letter might go astray. I have added a story to Dubliners and would have added another, perhaps, had I not been in such incertitude about the fate of the first twelve. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
