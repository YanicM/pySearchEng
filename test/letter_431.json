  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I have already replied to your kind telegram of 1 January and thank you again for your thoughtfulness in sending it. I hope you have now received the sheets from New York and that the English edition will be out early next month. May I ask you to send a copy also to the following address with the slip enclosed? Constantine Curran, 15 Garville Avenue, Dublin. I think the presentation copies are now twelve but I will ask you to send me here three more copies (the extra five—beyond the ten allowed for—being of course charged to my account) as I want one for myself and two for you and Mr Pound. In these latter I should like to write a few words if you will allow me to do so. Will you also let me know the published price of the English edition and the foreign postage (per dozen copies) so that I may remit you an order for such copies as I buy at trade price? I hope to be able to dispose of a few dozen here. I should also be glad to know if the American publisher has arranged to send you copies of American press notices. With many thanks and kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
