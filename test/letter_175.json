  "text": "Dear Stannie I have been so busy these days (and am so still) that I had no time to write. You appear to be exasperated at my financial distress. No wonder. I am sending you The Realist and O’Kelly’s book, a story of which he is dramatising in Sinn Féin, Also a paper called The Republic. You will notice that Cruise O’Brien’s ‘boy’ is auditor of U.C. Debating Society. There is a Welshman who is teacher in the school. He dined with us on New Years Eve and with him a lady manicurist. She invited us to dinner for New Year’s Day. She is young, lives alone, has a beautiful quarter: long dress, nervous. She has manicured the King of England. (We never say the ‘King’) All men are dolls or puppets, I think, except the English. My hatred of Italy and Italians is on the increase. I had to suspend this letter for three or four days. I have not a moment to myself all day. I have read Tales of Mean Streets by Morrison and Plain Tales from the Hills I suppose, after all, there must be some merit in my writing. No word from Long or Mathews. If I knew Ireland as well as R.K. seems to know India I fancy I could write something good. But it is becoming a mist in my brain rapidly. I have the idea of three or four little immortal stories in my head but I am too cold to write them. Besides, where’s the good. Ibsen, of course, may have liked that kind of sport. But then he never broke with his set. I mean, imagine Roberts or Fay, with an allowance from the Irish Republic moving round Europe with correspondence tied at his heels like a goat’s tether and you have H.I. In the same circumstances perhaps I too would be an egoarch. Anyhow I shall never be a model bank clerk. Everyone complains of my writing. I would tell you also a story of a letter I wrote in Italian but that it is too bloody long to tell. No more at present: rushing off to WORK. [Scene: draughty little stone-flagged room, chest of drawers to left, on which are the remains of lunch, in the centre, a small table on which are writing materials (He never forgot them) and a saltcellar: in the background, small-sized bed. A young man with snivelling nose sits at the little table: on the bed sit a madonna and plaintive infant. It is a January day.] Title of above: The Anarchist. I am stealing another moment to tell you that Aunt J— has written to me. The news is that O.G.’s mother is ‘beastly dead’ and that O.G. is very rich. I wonder was this the valuable news O.G. had in mind. I suppose he will write again after a decent interval. But I fear nothing short of £150 a year, free of duty, would be of any use to me. The other day I was thinking about my novel. How long am I at it now? Is there any use continuing it? Everyone appears to think I am behaving very well better than they expected. But it’s not pleasant behaving well to please people. I understand Nora is about to have another child. Certainly Georgie is the most successful thing connected with me. But he’s only a small part mine. I think he rather likes me, however. When I come to eat he pulls over the chair and says ‘Se’ (sede). I bought him a rocking-hoss the night of the Epiphany. 4 L. Are you annoyed? Next bout. They are celebrating this week in Sylvester’s Church the union of the rites. Every morning a different rite. I should love to go. But I might as well be in Cabra for all I see of anything Coptic, Greek, Chaldean &c. Excuse the way I scrawl. Any minute the banker [breaks off]",
