  "text": "Dear Stannie, It is Xmas Eve. 7 o’clock. I have eleven lire in my pocket. I thought you might have been able to send some by today but I suppose you couldn’t. Tomorrow we shall dine on paste as otherwise I cannot reach the end of the month. As we expected some money Nora paid four or five lire in debts. Well! (as Mr Pater beautifully says) I have reached the low-water mark in Xmases this ’ere time. This bank is closed only for tomorrow. I suppose you couldn’t relieve the agony at all? Let me know. Jim",
