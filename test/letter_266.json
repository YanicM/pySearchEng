  "text": "Dear Stannie It is 1 a.m. I have just come home from Mary St. where I have been for the last hour or so in a cellar under the house in the middle of electric wires. The show is not open yet. Every day there are disappointments. If I were to write you all the confusion here you would not find it amusing in the least. On Saturday night for example I was up till 4.30 a.m. sending express letters and telegrams for the Società to Trieste, London and Bucarest. I got home and a cannon woke me up at 7 a.m. I drove in the pelting rain and fog to Kingsbridge. We left for Cork at 8 a.m. and arrived at 1 p.m. For five rainy dreary hours we were mooning about Cork. At 6 p.m. we left for Dublin and arrived at 11.30 p.m. I was home at midnight, dined and sat down to write with the result that I got to my ricketty, naked bed at 3 a.m. Since this work began I have never been in bed before 3 or 3.30. I had no end of trouble and anxiety concerning landlords, and builders &c. Now the electrical engineer has left us in the lurch and the Società blames me for choosing him. How was I to know (I forgot to say that the trip to Cork was put down to my expense and cost me my share of outlay!!). I sent two advance posters to you today (designed by me) and that is all the news I have. I have not even got the licence yet as the Recorder is not sitting at present though I have had plenty of Irish promises. I am busy night, noon and morning. To my advts in the papers for staff hands &c I got nearly 200 replies and had to interview about 50 of them. I did not wish to write either to you, Schmitz, Francini or Vidacovich until the hall is open as I know the scalogna that follows me. I will wire the moment we open. As for money if you are supporting the Trieste branch I am doing the same here and have been practically since I came. Besides this Devin has borrowed money from me twice and wants me to ask M and R to go security for him for a loan!! MacDonnell, the medical student, also borrows from me every time I see him so does ‘Corley’ whom I ran into a tram to avoid. I don’t refuse them because I am thinking of my book. I have bought clothes for Eileen to help her get away from here with me and train her voice. Even if you have many lessons I suppose you have a peaceful house and good food. I have neither here and have much more work to do than you have. . At the present moment I have barely enough money to carry this house till Sunday. Get the chairs upholstered at M’s: same colour as sofa. Tell creditors I am opening C— in Dublin, show them posters and that will quiet them. Hang the posters in the kitchen with paste. I hope to open on Saturday and if so I shall be back in three weeks and am quite willing to allow you I/3 of my profits. Very tired now Jim",
