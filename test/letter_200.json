  "text": "Dear Poppie Thanks for sending on the music. I have seen your letter to Stannie and his reply which is enclosed with this. I have an idea which you will tell me if you like. I will send Georgie among you for six weeks or so next summer in charge of Stannie if you think such a proposal would have the effect desired. Neither he nor Stannie would be any expense as (if we can manage the thing at all) we shall pay all expenses of travelling and board with you. Perhaps he might be a good influence in your household and I fancy all of you would be glad to make his acquaintance. He could go about the end of July and come back to Trieste about the end of August or first of September. If you like the idea and think it likely to do good I shall write to Pappie myself. I suppose you will think this a hare-brained idea like all the others I have had hitherto but if you walk round it for about a quarter of an hour and look at it from all sides it will begin to look right enough. I will send him very gladly if that will make yiz all happy and loving. I told him I was going to and he has been canvassing all the people in the house for a valise to put his clothes in and go to ‘Dubirino’. Thank you, I feel a little better of the rheumatism and am now more like a capital S than a capital Z. Hoping this will find you as it leaves me at present, thank God, I am, dear sister, your Most Affectionate Brother Jim",
