  "text": "Dear Mr Walsh: The enclosed will explain my telegram. Many thanks for your kind reply and message. My sight is worse and I have to go to Paris at the end of September to undergo another (the 7th) operation on my eyes. I want to correct the proofs of these two pieces while I can as after the operation I shall not be able to do anything for a long while, I suppose. The editor of The Calendar wishes to publish his piece on 1 October. Can you let me have a proof of your piece early in September and fix the date of appearance of your review before the 1 October? In that case he will set his piece now and I can check both and be finished with them as I should like to have a few weeks of rest before I reenter the clinic. We are leaving for Arcachon. My address had better remain: 12 rue de lâ€™Odeon, Paris. I hope your own health keeps good. Please accept for Miss Moorhead and yourself our kind wishes sincerely yours James Joyce",
