  "text": "Dear Stannie Your M.O of £3–5–0 arrived this morning (Thursday) and am anxiously waiting your wire. I hope you will be able to send enough for me to bring Eva. She undergoes an operation of the tonsils in a day or two and the day after we could start. I sent cards to all the people I mentioned and hope to begin my lessons for the second half of September. If you have sent money for Eva and if I wire you that we both are leaving, get from the Jewman one of those camp beds large enough for her and Georgie, mattresses of crine vegetale and bolsters and pillow. No bedlinen. I will bring that, sheets, pillow slips, bolster slips and quilt. I did not show MS to T.M.K. as he is to be married next week and I don’t think it would be a nice thing to give him to read. Had the S’s asked me to their house I would have presented them with a specially bound copy of C.M. that work of works. Gogarty killed a child this week at Donnybrook by running over it in his motor. I called to several places about E’s voice but could see nobody. J.M.S’s brother makes a lot of difficulty about the rights of that play so I think I will let him follow J.M.S. to the Wicklow quarter of hell. The news I have is all tittle-tattle and will keep till I reach Trieste. I have had no trace of rheumatism in spite of all the rain and think it is the lithia I drink which is curing me. Paddy Harding was knocked ‘off of’ a car at Clontarf and was unconscious for an hour. Send me all the cash you can so that I may manage to bring Eva. It costs £6 a head. Jim",
