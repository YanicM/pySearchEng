  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Gorman leaves for U.S.A. on 26 returning February. He has to deliver a series of lectures on me. It is true that he and Mrs G. are being divorced. He, in fact, is engaged to be married to another divorced woman but this must not be known yet. I hear he has some stepchildren. Apart from this he wants to know when you expect to have access to your letters and I the same with regard to the MS of W.i.P. L.P.F. is now in favour again and on visiting terms. I met him outside a cafe. He was very friendly to me, took down address and telephone number etc. I won a large box of cigars from Miss Beach who bet that Sullivan (‘the most immoral man she had ever heard of’) had run off to South America with his mistress. He is, in fact, in Nice engaged for a big season there in Master singers. Mrs S. was here to tea chattering away gaily as usual about her two curious children. I gave the boy a lot of my ties as, like Giorgio, he is inclined to dandyism. Jarnach continues to hold up the O.U.P. book. I got Lucia (by a ruse) to make me elaborate capitals for the poems and sent them over. H.H. said it was too late. The book was set up. Now I have shown them to Mrs Crosby who admires them and proposes to make a very expensive edition of only 25 copies, facsimile of my handwriting. I would let Lucia draw the whole amount. I have to speak to Miss Beach about this as she has the world rights and also the original MS which I gave her along with that of Dubliners. Pinker writes asking what is Pomes Penyeach (is it by me?) and Faber and Faber who were to have sent me a larger type proof sent me on Nov. 20 (excuse this loose leaf) on Nov 20 a proof pulled on Oct 16 which is identical with the proof pulled on 21 Sept. Why doesn’t Ramshead Mac Dullard do something about it all, find a formula or something of that sort of thing. Another prospective tenant for ‘Chicken from Barkers’ wanted me to buy a shopful of china including a dozen eggcups etc. I wonder what kind of early Victorian breakfast parties she wanted to give. Several letters were exchanged and then she altered her intentions. The madman in Trieste has started writing to me again violent letters. At 8.30 on Tuesday Harold Nicholson will lecture on me over the London radio. He has written a broadcast pamphlet in which he calls me ‘the Einstein of English fiction’. I am stitching away like a cobbler. People are alarmed about S.G. I took him to the opera and have induced him to see Dr Fontaine of whom he is shy. Il y a des hommes comme ça. Kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
