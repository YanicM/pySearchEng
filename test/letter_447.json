  "text": "My dear Mr Quinn: I hope you will forgive the brevity of this letter. As my wife has already written you, I have been very ill for the past fortnight with glaucoma. Now it seems better and I can write again. It is very tiresome and the pain was rather strong. I am trying to avoid the operation as I dislike the idea of cutting out pieces of the iris at intervals. I cannot dictate to a stenographer or type. I write all with my hand. When the fair copy is ready I send it to a typist. I have here with me only the MS of Exiles. The MSS of Dubliners (and the only copy extant, so far as I know, of the burned first edition) and of A Portrait of the Artist are in my desk and so I cannot easily get them for the moment. However, I have sent you the MS of Exiles (through Mr Pound in London). This seems to me the quickest and safest way. I am much honoured by your proposal of buying it and am well content to leave the matter in your hands. To save time it might be possible to have it typed again (over there) and then submitted to my publisher in New York for his autumn list or to any manager who might think of putting it on. The marginal corrections—in pen and pencil—are to be followed, and the cost of typing can be charged to my account with my publisher. I am indeed grateful to you for the interest you are taking in me and hope I may deserve it, or some of it. You did not meet me in Dublin. Mr O’Donoghue asked me, I believe, in your name for some verses at the time of the St Louis exhibition. He was bringing out an anthology, I think, under your supervision. I shall be very glad to hear that my play has reached you safely and most interested to hear your opinion of it. I will conclude by asking you to convey to any of your friends who know me or remember me my regards, and to accept for yourself my very grateful and sincere thanks. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
