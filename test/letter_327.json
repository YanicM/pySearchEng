  "text": "Dear Aunt Josephine: I am very sorry to hear of Uncle Willie’s death though from what you told me I knew it was a matter of some months only. It is a very sad collapse and I do not know enough of the end to write you more fully. We had many wild nights together, many arguments. He was the only member of my mother’s family who seemed to take any pride out of my existence: and I can still remember the tone of his voice when he spoke of ‘my nephew’. After all he was a man, like us all or like many of us, worthy of a better life than he had assigned him. If you have time to write me afterwards I shall be very glad to hear from you and will certainly answer: though, to tell the truth, I dislike to see the Dublin postmark as all the envelopes contain sad news of death, poverty or failure of some kind. If I had known in time I should have sent a wreath in my name and in that of my children but I received a card (or rather Eileen received it) only on Thursday night. I telegraphed lest you might think I had known before then. Nora begs me to send you her condolence. I renew my own to you and yours. I hope at least that he did not suffer much towards the end. While I was writing this letter many memories came into my mind. Nearly all are pleasant memories: and these are perhaps the best legacy that one can leave to others. And so I take leave of him with pity and regret. If you will send me a copy of a photograph of his I shall be very glad indeed to have that reminder of a good-hearted and lively companion of my youth.",
