  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: I am sending this to your former address because your last letter is put away with other correspondence and I omitted to write the new address in my notebook. I think it is 67 Westminster Gardens? I hope you received the proofs and understood all my scrawls. My son thanks you as do I for your good offices and for those pro-ferred of Mr Gielgud. His (my son’s) experience of broadcasting in the U.S.A. (he sang for Columbia, the National Broadcasting Corporation and another one before the glandular trouble from which he has now made an astonishing recovery cut short his vocal career temporarily) is that these Radio Companies are all in watertight compartments and that the director who has charge of the singing almost resents even a friendly introduction from the director, say, who controls the sports programme. In this concrete case is it possible to find out who has charge of the singers or the vocal part of the musical programme and get into relation with him directly? I will send further details about my son (or he can send them himself) if we can get this information. As you already know, I think, he was born in Italy and has lived 17 years in Paris. He sings German also and of course English. He studied singing for about 5 years with Lujol of the Opéra and Cunelli, a retired Greek tenor of the Italian school. His voice is light bass (basse chantante). Paris is so full of international celebrities and will be for many months that it is hardly advisable for him to give a concert here at present. If he gets an audition in London I think he ought to get an engagement out of it. Voices seem to become rarer and rarer in that country. Thanks very much in any case but I should like to hear from you about this before I make any plans. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
