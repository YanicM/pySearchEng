  "text": "Dear Miss Beach: I hope you are back safe in Paris and enjoyed your holiday. I had to rob 3000 francs from you but I wrote to Walsh to send my cheque in name of Miss Moschos and to Eliot to send the other payable to you. Between these delays and no proofs and the unexpected long journey down here with four breaks I feel more fatigued than when I left Paris. I hope they send you those cheques to cover my advance. I draw 11.000 francs in ten days but do not know how to arrange till then. My sight is getting so bad in the good eye even that I am beginning to think I have an incipient cataract in it too. I want to correct both proofs as soon as possible. Hold U till my next letter arrives—probably Saturday morning—with last corrections and then send it off registered please. You will see by Walsh’s letter that This Quarter may not appear for months yet and I cannot hold up the Calendar indefinitely. Walsh’s review may come out on time. In any case please suggest that the Editor of Calendar add a footnote at the beginning of the piece to the effect (v. The Criterion, (July 1925), This Quarter, September, 1925) That is all I can do. What do you think of Gorman’s letter⁠[?] As you see, Exiles is to be given by the Stage Society. I said you would supply particulars of the performances. You know the story New York:??! Paris:??????? Italy: translated by Carlo Linati??? Germany: given at Schauspielhaus Munich. Producer: Elizabeth Koerner. Complete fiasco. Row in theatre. Play withdrawn. Author invited but not present. German Foreign Office did not allow his entrance. Thank God. Arcachon is a very nice place. It is near Dax. I ought to go there and get into the fontaine chaude and stay in it and never trouble everybody no more. It is a pity Darantière is so slow about U. VI, isn’t it With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
