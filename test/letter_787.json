I have been working myself silly and revising proof of the four masters or evangelists for the T.R. What a job, too! What is your address? Is this right? I want to return you the money. Miss Beach says you are coming on here. Will you please drop me a line? I hope you have had a good sunny time. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
