  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I hope you got my wire for the 1st. What changes since we last dined on that date at Kettner’s! We leave for Z’ch tomorrow. Same hotel. The fares Feldkirch-Nice are so high that we will have to go 2nd, crush or not. Even then they come to over £30…. Vogt is in Holland, receiving great honour, I hear. I had a letter from him and he wants to see me. Sent him the notices. He will be back in Z’ch on Sunday, Borach says…. The Japanese sent me a cheque for 200 yen (£10, circa) for their depredations. I have been working all day since I came here. It is a risk to present oneself to the writing public (for those are my readers) after some years and in such a whirl. But I will do it. By the next post you will get the first proof (unfinished) which please read and return to Mrs Jolas. As regards blame every young writer in the world, I suppose, blames me for having written U. So Jolas says, anyhow….",
