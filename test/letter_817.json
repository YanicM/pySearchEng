  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: It was very good of you to send all those notices in the midst of your rush. How politely Brother Jonathan tries to place the blame for his blunder on your shoulders and what a nice sweet neat amiable little letter Mr Bennett sent. I wish the novel had been published without these critical remarks on its jacket. The other cuttings are of a piece. I am sorry Mr Lewis was in a bad mood. Did you mention the portrait to him? I wonder why Mr Eliot had to fly over here to see what Shaun calls the proprietoress. Mr Larbaud tells me he is invited to a dinner there for that occasion consisting of steak and a pound and a half of bacon with some chops followed by beefsteak with a splendid onion and fried bacon and grilled steak. I enclose a letter which explains everything. As I expected the temperature is on the rise. I am now deep in the confidence of both camps. Larbaud has now definitely broken with Fargue who is closely connected with Ippolita (M—d—e la Pr—nc—ss d— B—st—n—. I give her this name because that is the name of a lady who throws somebody or herself under an Italian goods train set in motion by signor Gabriel of the Annunciation who is sentimentally championed by Larbaud who has been denounced by Miss Monnier who is helped by Miss Beach. Larbaud has been warned not to walk, run or creep through the rue de l’Odéon. Ippolita told several people that A.M. was a bookseller and A.M. told me about Ippolita and several people and V.L. told me about A.M. and Fargue and Ippolita and then we had some steak followed by fried bacon with rashers and two pounds of Ippolita which was quite tender after the goods engine followed by a splendid muddle. My wife went to see Dr Borsch. The result: tomorrow he is not free, Tuesday is a holiday. I shall see him on Wednesday. He says he will have to make a larger operation—similar to that in Zurich—that I am highly nervous and in consequence of repeated attacks there is a great deal of secretion. He said I will get back my sight! It is very weak today so I shall not write much more. I think that at last I have solved one—the first—of the problems presented by my book. In other words one of the partitions between two of the tunneling parties seems to have given way. I shall be glad to have Penguin Island. With many thanks and kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
