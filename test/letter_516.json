  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Will you please send a copy of my novel to Mr Georges Bazile, 13 Quai Conti, Paris. He wishes to translate it, he writes. I regret the delay in forwarding the episode of the Sirens but perhaps I am the only person who finds it a subject for regret. I have had some worries which prevent me from doing much. I think I shall go away to Italian Switzerland for a few days at least. With kind regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
