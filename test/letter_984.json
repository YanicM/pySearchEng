  "text": "Dear Mrs Schmitz: A Trieste newspaper has been forwarded to me from Le Havre in which there is a paragraph about the fatal accident to poor Schmitz and the injuries to yourself. I telegraphed you at your Trieste address although I did not know where you were. We are all greatly shocked to hear of his death. A very sympathetic notice by Madame Crémieux appeared in the Nouvelles Littéraires and I am having a copy sent to you. I am also asking the editor of transition to reprint, by permission of the same paper, Mr Nino Frank’s article written when you were last here which is the best literary portrait I can recall of my old friend. I, at least, can see him through the lines of it. Later on, when time and the remembrance of your own devotion to Italo Svevo have in some way reconciled you to such a loss will you please let me know what success he had with the English and American publishers to whom I had recommended him? I spoke to his German publisher in Zürich in July and he told me they would bring the book out this autumn. I hope you have recovered from your shock and your injuries. It is perhaps a poor, but still some consolation, to remember that our meetings here in Paris were so pleasant to us all. Please remember me if at any time my help can serve to keep alive the memory of my old friend for whom I had always affection and esteem. To yourself, dear Mrs Schmitz, and to your daughter, all our sympathy.",
