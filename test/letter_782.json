  "text": "Dear Ford: Thanks for your note and for the trouble Mrs Ford and yourself took to check my proof. However, as it seemed to me almost impossible that you could revise such a tricky proof I went to Clarke’s. The foreman had gone and the clerk could not find my proof. He said he thought it might be on the machine. I asked him to telephone to me tomorrow morning and then drove to Quai d’Anjou but, not finding you, left my name. My checking of the proof would mean a delay of about an hour and much relief to myself. I hope it is still possible. I explained in a letter to Mrs Ashworth that I could not go to the printer’s on Thursday but would go on Friday. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
