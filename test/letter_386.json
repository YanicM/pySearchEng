Will you please send the September number of The Egoist therefore direct from your office to me under your printed wrapper so that I may receive it promptly? As this will be the last instalment of my novel I feel that I owe you my sincere thanks for the interest you have taken in my writing and for the trouble you have taken to protect my text. I am very grateful to your paper and to your staff and hope you will have a more prosperous career when these bad days are past. Very sincerely yours James Joyce",
