  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I hope you received Yabcd. I shall be waiting to hear how you like it—if you like it. While reading it could you make a complete list of words misspelt. Some, of course, are intentional, most, but there must be others overlooked by my dim sight. Will you let me know whether the ‘plot’ begins to emerge from it at all? Between the close of U at nightfall and Ya there are three or four other episodes, the children’s games, night studies, a scene in the ‘public’, and a ‘lights out in the village’. Have you finished S. Patrice? If so, I should like you to read St John Irvine’s Life of Parnell to begin with. It is not good but you ought to know some of the facts. For instance the word ‘hesitency’. Irishmen usually remember the Piggott trial by this catchword. I shall send you Bédier Tristan et Iseult as this too you ought to read. Cain and Co, Swift etc and the ‘other fellow’ I shall leave to your own inter pretative discernment…. I hope your sister is still making progress. I think my eye is improving slightly. But I would not for my sight’s sake be so advanceful as yet as to take my affirmative eachways as to the preceding.",
