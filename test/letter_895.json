  "text": "Dear Stannie: I enclose Lire 6000.—in draft on Trieste and Milan. I hope it reaches you in time with our best wishes to Nelly and yourself. Let me know if you get it. I am utterly overworking myself. Roth is pirating Ulysses (bowdlerized) in a new monthly magazine of which he sells 50,000 copies a month. I have tried to enjoin the publication but there seems to be no remedy. The Germans, having given me four days at Ostende, to revise the translation with the translator (we did 88 pages) are now rushing the translation into print. It is of course full of the absurdest errors and with large gaps. Such is financial literature. If they do not give me a délai, I shall ask Miss Beach to circularize the German press with a disclaimer. I hope your arrangements are all made and that your marriage will soon come off and that it will be a very happy one. Buona fortuna! Jim",
