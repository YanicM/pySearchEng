  "text": "Dear Mr Richards: You have a small balance of 37/6d to my credit and you will oblige me by wiring on receipt of this whether you agree to 15 November as date of publication of Exiles. Your compliance with my request will serve your interests as well as mine. It will release a typescript copy if the play is set up now and allow my agent to offer it to some theatres. It will allow me to bring the play as soon as possible under the notice of publishers and managers on the continent with a view to publication and production: and, by setting my mind at rest, it will allow me to get on more quickly with my novel Ulysses which, if all goes well, I hope to have ready for publication next year. Mr Archer writes that he never received from you the copy of Dubliners I asked you to send in June 1914 and again in August or November 1915! Sincerely yours James Joyce",
