It will be in the Transatlantic Review next number. I read you a mere sketch a year ago. But perhaps you read it in the folder. But I donâ€™t think you had time. I am nearly stunned by this way of life. O, mon dieu! Did Miss Beach send you the N.Y. Times? I think it ought to be answered. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
