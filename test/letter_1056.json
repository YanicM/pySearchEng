  "text": "Dear Stannie: The telegraphic address is on top. Please wire me the word ‘yes’ or ‘no’ if you have received a second letter from Gorman and again the same word rispettivamente whether you agree to his proposal to have the letters or passages you deem most important copied at his expense at once and forwarded to him here: address: Hotel Place de l’Odeon, Place de l’Odeon, Paris. I never promised Schmitz or his wife any such thing. I do not write prefaces. I hope the ceremony of the 26 will be a crowning affair for whenever I mentioned S’s name to any of my semi-literate pupils they laughed in my face. Will you please get the information Giorgio asked for re Corti and his brother as soon as possible and send it to him so that the prefecture de police here may send orders to the frontier? I am sorry you share his opinion of my recent writings. Am leaving for England in a day or two when I recover from a nervous breakdown I had. Permanent address: 12 rue de l’Odeon, Paris. I shall explain my plans later. I am not coming back to Paris probably till late autumn. Kindest regards to Nellie and yourself. Jim",
