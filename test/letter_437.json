  "text": "Dear Curran: Many thanks for your friendly and interesting letter. I had already seen the notices by Mr Wells and Mr Brock. I am glad that my book has given you some pleasure. I hope you received also the presentation copy of my book of stories Dubliners which I asked Mr Richards to send you when it appeared—June 1914.1 have not yet seen any American notices of the novel. It was published in New York before Christmas. I am recovering from a painful—and this time dangerous—illness of the eyes. I am now out of pain and much better and this morning the doctor was very optimistic so that I hope it will not be necessary to operate. You are very kind to ask what I am writing. My play Exiles which was rejected in Turin, Berne, and Chicago and also here and by the Stage Society (London) is being read by Yeats for the Abbey Theatre. I do not know if he will put it on. He wrote that ‘the theatre should face a riot to stage it.’ In any case I shall publish it in the autumn. I finished it in 1915. I am writing Ulysses which I began six or seven years ago in Rome and hope I shall be able to finish it in 1918. The omissions you speak of will be made good as you suppose. A few verses of mine were printed in Poetry (Chicago) last year, I believe. I did not see them. I hope that you and yours are well and beg you to give my regards to any who remember me. With all good wishes sincerely yours James Joyce",
