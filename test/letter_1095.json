  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: My American lawyers having again asked for a payment of the other 2000 $ I sent Conner the enclosed letter which please return. Miss Beach raised an objection to my sending it on account of a ‘falsehood’ in it which would be shown up if C. asked to see my contract with her. The ‘falsehood’ was in the phrase stating that when I filed the suit I apparently was not the owner of the U.S. rights. She says I was. I replied that the contract must have been simply a putting into writing of her pre-existent intention. To which she said I was the owner then etc. Nevertheless I sent the letter. Souppault, who goes returns [sic] to U.S.A. in a month proposed to put the French consul-gencral of N.Y. on the track of the new Roth edition, it being a contrefaçon of a French printer’s output just as a falsified French perfume would be and a meeting was arranged between him, Miss Monnier and Miss Beach Léon and myself. But Miss Monnier then asked me to go to see her alone. She read me a letter she had written to Paul Claudel, the ambassador, who is a lunatic catholic, she says, and intensely annoyed by U (he sent back a presentation copy of the first edition) but has lost prestige as a poet so much with the younger generation that she thinks, with the aid of Gillet’s article which she also sent, that he will take this opportunity to rehabilitate himself. I doubt very much that she is right. It is not an ambassador’s job though a consul might effect a seizure of the copies. Possibly Claudel is a convert like Maritain and if so his protestant mentality would well suit an Irish catholic element over there which is of an even worse breed. She also told me that the N.R.F. angered at her refusal to give them U had decided to favour Lawrence’s Lady Chatterli’s [sic] Lover, which is coming out in French. I also received a letter from a man in England who has nearly completed a long study and exegesis of this work and has obtained opinions about it from G.B.S., A.H., O.S., M.M. and E.T.C. and wants an opinion from me. These are all to be printed in front of this study and exegesis of this work. In the middle of my own work have I got to listen to this. I read the first 2 pages of the usual sloppy English and G.S. read me a lyrical bit about nudism in a wood and the end which is a piece of propaganda in favour of something which, outside of D.H.L.’s country at any rate, makes all the propaganda for itself. T.S.E. has been appointed professor at Harvard and is to leave England next year. Good Lord! Have I to deal with those printers face to face? Kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
