  "text": "Dearest Tomorrow night we leave. At the last moment I have managed everything and Eva is coming. Prepare for us. I was trying to recall your face but could only see your eyes. I want you to look your best for me when I come. Have you any nice clothes now? Is your hair a good colour or is it full of cinders? You have no right to be ugly and slovenly at your age and I hope now you will pay me the compliment of looking well. I am excited all day. Love is a cursed nuisance especially when coupled with lust also. It is terribly provoking to think that you are lying waiting for me at this moment at the other end of Europe while I am here. I am not in a nice mood just now. Let me talk of your present. Do you like the idea? Or do you think it as mad as myself? Has your mother or sister written to you about me? I rather fancy they liked me. How stupid I am asking you questions you have no time to answer! Keep that piano and get a camp bed for Eva and Georgie. Be sure and have a fine warm dinner or supper or breakfast for us when we arrive. You will, won’t you? You will let me feel from the first moment I put my foot inside my house that I am going to be happy in every way. Don’t begin to tell me stories about debts we owe. I will ask you, darling, to be as kind to me as you can be as I am dreadfully nervous from all the worry and pensieri I have had, very very nervous indeed. How strange it will be when I first catch sight of you! To think of you waiting, waiting there for me to come back! I hope you will like my sister Eva. People say it is unwise to bring a sister into the house but you asked me to, dear. You will be kind to her, I am sure, my good-hearted little Nora. And perhaps in two years’ time your sister Dilly will come to stay with us for a few months. My darling, I have such a lot to tell you and will tell it to you every night in the intervals of doing something else. What a moment that is, dear! A brief madness or heaven. I know I lose my reason for the time it lasts. At first how cold you were, Nora, do you remember? You are a strange little person. And sometimes you are very warm indeed. Have some appearance of money when I go back. Will you make me a nice cup of black coffee in a nice small cup? Ask that snivelling girl Globocnik how to do it. Make a good salad, will you? Another thing don’t bring onions or garlic into the house. You will think I am going to have a child. It is not that but I don’t know what to do I am so upset and excited. My dear, dear, dear little Nora goodbye now for tonight. I wrote you every night. Now I am not too bad: and I am bringing you my gift. O, Lord, how excited I am! Jim",
