  "text": "Dear love How sick, sick, sick I am of Dublin! It is the city of failure, of rancour and of unhappiness. I long to be out of it. I think always of you. When I go to bed at night it is a kind of torture for me. I will not write on this page what fills my mind, the very madness of desire. I see you in a hundred poses, grotesque, shameful, virginal, languorous. Give yourself to me, dearest, all, all when we meet. All that is holy, hidden from others, you must give to me freely. I wish to be lord of your body and soul. There is a letter which I dare not be the first to write and which yet I hope every day you may write to me. A letter for my eyes only. Perhaps you will write it to me and perhaps it will calm the anguish of my longing. What can come between us now? We have suffered and been tried. Every veil of shame or diffidence seems to have fallen from us. Will we not see in each other’s eyes the hours and hours of happiness that are waiting for us? Adorn your body for me, dearest. Be beautiful and happy and loving and provoking, full of memories, full of cravings, when we meet. Do you remember the three adjectives I have used in The Dead in speaking of your body. They are these: ‘musical and strange and perfumed’. My jealousy is still smouldering in my heart. Your love for me must be fierce and violent to make me forget utterly. Do not let me ever lose the love I have for you now, Nora. If we could go on together through life in that way how happy we should be. Let me love you, Nora. Do not kill my love. I am bringing you a little present. It is all my own idea and I have had great trouble in getting it done as I wished. But it will always remind you of this time. Write to me, dearest, and think of me. What is a week or ten days to all the time of joy before us! Jim",
