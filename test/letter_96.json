  "text": "Dear Stannie The child was born on Thursday last the 27th July at nine o’clock in the evening. It was almost by accident I was in the city that day as I had had the intention of going away to a bathing-place. When I came back from the café at three o’clock I found Nora in pain. I had no notion it was for birth but when it continued for a long time I went to the landlady and told her. She sent for her midwife and then there was proper confusion if you like. The room was all pulled about. Nora had hardly anything made not expecting the event till the end of August. However, our landlady is a Jewess and gave us everything we wanted. I told her to get everything that was wanted and gave her all the money I could lay hands on. Then I went for Dr Sinigaglia who is one of my pupils. He came at once and returned in time to help Nora to give birth to the child. He says I must have miscalculated the time as it is a perfectly normal child. The people here made me go in to dinner with them and at about nine in came the old aunt Jewess smiling and nodding ‘Xe un bel maschio, Signore’. So then I knew an heir was born. It was not very pleasant for me—the six hours—but it must have been a damn sight worse for Nora. But Dr Sinigaglia told me she was very brave and hardly uttered a cry, only clapped her hands when she heard it was a boy. She is very well. The child appears to have inherited his grandfather’s and father’s voices. He has dark blue eyes. He has a great taste for music because while I was nursing him yesterday he eyed me with great fixity as I whistled several operatic airs for him. Nora gives him her own milk. I wonder would you mind applying to the much lamented Curran. I am in a slight fix, as you may suppose. I hardly like to do this but perhaps he will allow me to ‘borrow’ a pound from him. It’s very expensive for me and I was quite unprepared. Many thanks for your telegram in reply. I am expecting a letter from you and a parcel, long overdue. I enclose a fortune which a white mouse picked for me this morning. I intended it for the child but it seems applicable to myself. Please attend to the material side of this letter. I hope that you are all delighted now that you have all been made uncles and aunts of. Jim",
