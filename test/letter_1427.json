  "text": "Dear Mr O’Casey: I wonder whether you have seen already the Dublin paper I sent you with its curious misprint—if it is a misprint. I hope it may be prophetical and that we may some day meet. When my wife recovers from an attack of influenza we are going to see your play at the Theatre de l’Oeuvre and if I find that it is attributed to me I shall certainly send you on the programme. Anyhow I hope you will take the printer’s error, as I do, for a happy and amusing omen. With all good wishes sincerely yours James Joyce",
