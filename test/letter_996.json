  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Giorgio made his debut last night (v. programme). He had no stage fright and even scowled round on the pianist when the latter (wilfully, he says) made a mistake. He sang quite well. I am working night, noon and morning. C.K. Ogden is doing the preface. G.S. [sic] has sent an article of his Ulysses work to the Fortnightly which wished to see it when he, at my suggestion, wrote to W.L. Courtney (died Nov. ’28). E.P. dines with us tonight. More anon. You will scarcely recognise my fables now. Picasso was too busy to do me so Brancusi did it. I was awake nearly all last night trying to solve a problem in elementary mathematics—all this for a word or two. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
