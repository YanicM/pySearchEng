  "text": "Dear Stannie Volta is to be sold tomorrow to the Provincial Theatre Co, Ltd for £1000. This is the society I told Pappie to offer it to. If he had done so I should have got 4000 crowns and he £20 commission from me. Novak, a stranger, has succeeded in doing it. They are depositing 1000 crowns for me with Vidacovich and tomorrow at 11 a.m. I have to go to the British consulate to dispatch a power of attorney for the sale. Coates has accepted the new tenants who have taken the place for ten years and, of course, will make it pay for of course Dublin will give support to Englishmen, but not to Irish and Italians. I believe Novak has dropped nearly all his money in the affair. They are losing 40% of their capital. Kindly call here as early as possible tomorrow (Tuesday) morning as I want to wind up the affair properly. I leave here before ten as I have a lesson. They have lost money and there is no reason why I should make them lose more so I decided to accept the terms. Had Pappie done what I told him two months ago I should have made £150. Price is ill in bed and asks will we go to see him tomorrow. I sent word to them to come here but Mrs Price came to say that their journey has to be put off. Come up here on receipt of this. Jim",
