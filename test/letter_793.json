  "text": "Dear Miss Bollach: I wanted to write to you several days ago but I have had a rather bad nervous collapse from overwork. I have again a request to make which, I am sure, will bore you greatly. Mr Valery Larbaud asked me to let him have a copy of the Anna Livia piece (enclosed) and I have also promised one to a relative in Ireland who has done a good deal of research for me. So could you make three fresh copies of it without the blanks in the paging? If so, I shall be extremely obliged though I can imagine how tiresome it is to type the same thing three or four times over. Mr Larbaud leaves for Italy in a few days but if you are pressed for time please let me know. I shall call on your concierge in any case. With this is a copy of the French translation of my first novel which I beg you to accept with many thanks for your promptness and courtesy. Apologising for the short notice I am giving you Sincerely yours James Joyce",
