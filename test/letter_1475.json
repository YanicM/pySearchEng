I asked you for the name of the successor of Prof. Fehr and of a critic in Berne who writes for the Bund, if I remember rightly. These names are for my publishers. A propos, there is a lot about Zurich in my biography by Herbert Gorman (Farrar and Rinehart, New York) which is now on sale in Europe. Greetings from us both sincerely yours James Joyce",
