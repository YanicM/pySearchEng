  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver … since you ask me I think there is a very very slight improvement of vision. He is now using some kind of a new chemical stimulant (not chemical but acting by purely physical means, recently discovered here, I understand, synthol for massaging the temples and brow). And as for Exiles the enclosed letter from my former partner in the English Players throws a good deal of light on the production, especially the production in the auditorium. I am sorry I did not engage a stenographer to record the debate…. Many thanks for Dowland’s songs. They at least are beyond question. I could never sing them but I could listen to them all day. I mean I have the voice but not the style. I hope something I have written may bear comparison with Come silent night for instance. I used the rhythm of William Bird’s Woods so Wild in describing Isolde in the last piece. This, completed and revised, I read a week ago to a small audience…. It produced stupefaction, I think. That evening I was exhausted to the point of idiocy and since then, though I wanted to revise Yabc for Mr Roth, could not do so. Instead I read a few books and plays, the Life of Sims Reeves, Juno and the Paycock, Figgis’s Book on Blake. Please let me hear from you how your sister progresses. I hope she will speedily recover and that you yourself will keep in good health. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
