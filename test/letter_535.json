  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I enclose a cutting from a Trieste paper which a friend of mine has sent me. Curiously enough it mentions an article which (the writer states) I sent to the Piccolo of Trieste from … the isle of Wight! I suppose he alludes to an article I wrote from Aran. There are two other inaccuracies: the allusion to a Spanish criticism (an honour I have not yet received) and to the deathmask of Beethoven—it was a Pompeian theatre mask. As I have begun to comment on this cutting I had better explain the interlined writing. The allusion is to my brother Stanislaus, who is nicknamed in Trieste ‘omo salta’ (the man on springs) on account of his walk. I ought to have replied before now to the material points raised in your letters. I have no wish to submit my novel to Mr Richards unless you should decide not to publish it. I am glad you have found a person who will print it. I never heard anything more of Mr Bazile or Mr Fels. If Mr Bagnan wants to translate my novel perhaps he could let me see three pages of his translation from the first, fourth and fifth chapters. I hope this will not seem offensive. I beg you, when writing, to express to him at the same time my thanks for his friendly praise. Mr Davray wrote to me asking me to write for a review of his (Anglo-French Review). I replied that I could not do so but sent him two pieces of verse. One he printed, the other he sent back as he was afraid ‘the students who read his review would not like it’. As regards Verbannte I cannot find out what has happened. It seems to have been a stormy evening. The play was at once withdrawn. The management of the theatre wrote, saying that it was ‘a great success’ and that ‘they were very glad to have been the first to produce it’. The Berliner Tageblatt, Vossische Zeitung and Neue Freie Presse had articles about the performance—one contradicting the other. Now I hear it was withdrawn because the chief actor fell ill—perhaps as a result of my lines—and that it is to go into the autumn bill. I wrote to Mr Linati about an Italian translation. I should like to see Mr Quinn’s article—I do not know Mr Pound’s address. I hope you have enjoyed your holiday. With kind regards and renewed good wishes sincerely yours James Joyce",
