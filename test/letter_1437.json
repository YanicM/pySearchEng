  "text": "Dear Budgen: Thanks for article and format received. I shall write you about it when I get back to Paris, that is, after Lucia’s birthday, the 26th. So far, I have received over 400 press notices and I think I may send a dozen picked which perhaps you ought to see. These I should want returned of course. It seems to me an excellent article but I am sure you can amplify it at at least three points with advantage to it and to yourself materially as the Fortnightly pays per page. I am almost sure they will take it if you write a letter on the lines I suggested. The fact that he was in the rival 19th Century doesn’t mean much for they don’t cover the same ground. I see you had more B.A. workers in Britain yesterday. Sunny summer seems to have become a misnomer. It’s not hot here. My gracious is it expensive. My daughter-in-law is in Switzerland. I hope that Money bags knows what Ireland expects that every man this day will do Very friendly regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
