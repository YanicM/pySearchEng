  "text": "Dear Stannie I send you the fourth story of ‘Dubliners’—‘Hallow Eve’—which I want you to offer at once to the Editor of the Irish Homestead. Perhaps they are annoyed with me and won’t honour me by printing any more. In case it is accepted I enclose a receipt—you can receive the money yourself and post it to me. Say you will be glad to be paid as soon as convenient. The ‘Irish Independent’ is really awful—I could not read any of the Celtic Christines except the verse which seemed to be almost unbearably bad except Collumb’s piece which wasn’t too bad, I thought. But ask the good young gentlemen can they beat ‘Hallow Eve’. I have written to Grant Richards and have sent a song ‘Bid adieu’ to Harper’s. Is there any news of Irish Voices?—try and see O’Donoghue. Have any of the volumes of Roberts’ press appeared and are they still disposed to print me. I expect you to write to me much oftener than you do. You know I have no-one to talk to. Nora, of course, doesn’t care a rambling damn about art. When she read ‘Mildred Lawson’ she said Moore didn’t know how to finish a story—when she saw me copy Epiphanies into my novel she asked would all that paper be wasted—which made me think of Heine. She wants me to hurry up the novel and get rich and go to live in Paris. Paris and Zurich she likes very much but Pola is a queer old place. You are not to give my address to anyone without first asking my leave—this is why I want you to receive the money from the Homestead. What is wrong with all these Irish writers—what the blazes are they always snivelling about? Isn’t it funny to read Roberts’ poems about a mother pressing a baby to her breast? O, blind, snivelling, nose-dropping, calumniated Christ wherefore were these young men begotten? Jim",
