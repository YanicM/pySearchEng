  "text": "Dear Mr Joyce: I thank you for your kind and considerate letter which is a refreshing change after my recent experience. The Frankfurter Zeitung and the translator seem to have treated you with almost as scant courtesy as they have used towards myself. I am still, however, nearly as much in the dark as the person in your story. Am I to understand from your letter that the translator obtained a copy of the December issue of the London Mercury and translated your story without authorization from you? Or did you send her the issue and has she merely omitted to inform you of its publication in Germany? I, myself, learnt of the publication as you did, by chance Sincerely yours James Joyce",
