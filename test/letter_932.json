  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: … The publication of P.P. is of course held up. Pinker, my ‘agent’ sent back Yabcd from the U.S.A. No editor there would pay a cent for it. Also the one copy of the 1st burnt edition of Dubliners which I sent by MacLeish to America two months ago to be offered to Rosenbach has not yet been sold. I shall not be able to get any royalties of Ulysses IX for about six weeks. I have rent and fares and insurance to pay in the course of a week so I wish you could ask Messrs Monro to sell £100 for me and I will wire MacLeish to remit the sale sum to them for my account. Of course I put a stop price on it of $500. Everything is greatly strained and tragic here lately. I got about 100 press clippings from all parts of the world, including Australia, ridiculing and attacking K and the other pieces. I foresee a good deal of difficulty in navigating Ulysses French version in view of recent events but I think I ought to have the opportunity of seeing that done before I finally retreat from here ‘carrying my coat under my arm so as to look like a philofficer’.",
