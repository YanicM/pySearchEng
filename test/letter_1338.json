  "text": "Dear Lord Carlow: What is the name of your friend at the B.B.C. and of what department is he chief? Perhaps you could give me a note to him so that my son Giorgio could have an audition in London. He could go over about the end of June probably when and if life becomes a little more normal. Also my friend Louis Gillet (who wrote the preface to the Chaucer A.B.C.) is in London till about the 19 inst. He is a great admirer of T.E. Lawrence and would like to see your press and your books. Perhaps you could manage to meet him. He is at the Savoy. And finally. Faber and Faber have sent me a bundle of proofs of ‘Work in Progress’ and as their printer is nearing Miss Storiella could you send to my friend T.S. Eliot of that firm a list of the few corrections and additions to the text they have being very careful not to forget that marvellous marginal monosyllable ‘Sic’. As I do not know your new address I am sending this to the old address, transition is still swimming bravely across the seven seas, a wave a week. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
