  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I wrote you a letter a few hours ago but my daughter who is an ‘absentminded beggar’ lost it somewhere in the street. So I repeat it here. My agent sent me a cheque for royalties on my book less his commission (£15.4.0). I am most grateful to you for your promptness in settling the account. As regards the second edition if you have additional expense with the English printing and if your very slender margin of profit (I fear you have little or none) be thereby reduced I suggest that you introduce some modification in your favour into the contract and add it with my agent’s approval. I agree in advance to anything you propose. A notice appeared in the Greek review ‘Eσπερία (29 June, p. 410). I think the editor is entitled to a copy of the book. Dr C. Pouptis, 62 Oxford Street. I wrote him yesterday but sent the letter to 62 Chancery Lane by mistake! I am rather unlucky with the post this week. Mr Richards will publish in autumn my play Exiles. I hope you will understand that it was offered to him first as by a contract which my agent says is ‘disastrous’ he has the right of refusal. I should much prefer you to publish it but alas such an offer would be in any case a dubious gift. Enclosed are some English press notices. I had them printed for insertion in the review copies of Exiles. I do not know how many copies will be in the edition. 1200 is I think the normal edition for a novel: perhaps 700 or 800 only for a play. If you and Mr Richards approve and if it is permitted to have printed matter imported from here perhaps it would be well to insert the leaflet in all copies of the edition. I have already paid for the setting and line of the type and for the copies I ordered so that the extra expense would be only the cost of the paper about 1.50 francs per 100 copies, that is about 10/- for an edition of 700. I am willing to defray this expense if you and Mr Richards approve. Meanwhile I have asked the printer to keep the type set, pending your reply.",
