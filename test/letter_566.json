  "text": "Dear Budgen: I take my pen in hand for to write you these few lines. The oxen of the bloody bleeding sun are finished. Typing nearly so. Will send you if I do not hear that you have changed address. If you are in city could you find out Sykes’ English address at the pension. Wrote him twice to Rome an important letter about E.P. A long article (sent by me, penned by him) appeared in D. Telegraph and now editor wants to get into touch with the company. It may be a chance for him. Where is he? Next item. If I get in enough money by end of June I must get a holiday. As Ireland is impossible I thought of transporting family for 2 months to Welsh or Cornish coast. When and where are you going? When and where are we likely to meet? I mean if you are in London when I am passing through then. I dislike going for many reasons but I suppose I must. Couldn’t stick this place in summer. No 3. It struck me that in some of your leisure hours you might feel inclined to make a few pen sketches or whatever they are about Ulysses. If you thought well of it could they not be placed somewhere (I am continually getting letters from unknown editors) and you get paid for them. S’elp me I’m alius a thinking o’ wot I ken do fer you. If you had of taken moy advoyse yid naw be rowlin in yer kerridge, saw ye wud. Is this a stupid idea? I suggest Bloom and the bat, dialogue between ‘I’ and Pisser Burke, Suter’s design of the Heimkehr, Father Conmee blessing the sinners, Bloom’s bath &c. Please write to me about Oxen. It cost me 1000 hours of work I calculate. There remains Circe. The end is plainer sailing. I am sure Zurich must be horrible now. But I should like a litre of Fendant in that famous corner. By the way, what about that photograph? Remember me to the Suters and their sister. Greetings from us all here and in view of the limited time please drop a line on receipt. James Joyce",
