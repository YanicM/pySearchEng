  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: My brother, expelled from Italy, is due here on the 16 inst, with or without his wife and bulldog. My son has to remain in bed or on a couch for 4 or 5 months. My daughter is in a madhouse where I hear she fell off a tree. I have to pay the following bills immediately if not sooner: I paid already the American Hosp. fee and the surgeon Dr Bone who operated me. The reason I have to pay Drs Welti and Garnier and the reason I already paid (2000 frs) to the Clinique at Asniers where my son was operated is that my son asked me to do so. I also paid prof. Agadjarian 1700 frs. After these payments there will remain outstanding only Dr Islandsky and whatever is still due to Dr Macdonald. I believe I can cover most of the expenses of publication of my daughter’s alphabet. My idea is not to persuade her that she is a Cezanne but that on her 29th birthday in the aforesaid madhouse she may see something to persuade her that her whole past has not been a failure. The reason I keep on trying by every means to find a solution for her case (which may come at any time as it did with my eyes) is that she may not think that she is left with a blank future as well. I am aware that I am blamed by everybody for sacrificing that precious metal money to such an extent for such a purpose when it could be all done so cheaply and quietly by locking her up in an economical mental prison for the rest of her life. I will not do so as long as I see a single chance of hope for her recovery, nor blame her or punish her for the great crime she has committed in being a victim to one of the most elusive diseases known to man and unknown to medicine. And I imagine that if you were where she is and felt as she must you would perhaps feel some hope if you felt that you were neither abandoned nor forgotten. Some mysterious malady has been creeping over both my children (the doctors are inclined to trace it back to our residence in Switzerland during the war) and if they have not succeeded in doing anything for themselves it is to blame, not they. My daughter’s case is far the worse of the two though how my son was able to do even as much as he did with his voice in the U.S. in such a state as he was (he could not lift a cup often from the table much less control his vocal chords) is also a mystery to me. Léon says I am to write this letter. Very rightly. I suppose. He does not wish to be blamed for having been a complacent party to my financial suicide. I like writing it just as much as you will like reading it. For several years he has been asking me insistently to write a letter of explanation to the British Trustee, begging His Excellency to allow me, who am known to all as a wholesale squanderer, to cash some moneys, entrusted to him for the education of my children. I never met him and I don’t know who he is or what he has to do with my two children and I do not intend to write him any letter black or white on the subject. Blockhead as he probably is he might well be excused for wondering why I should now be needing this money for the education of Giorgio aged 31 and father of a son aged 4½ and Lucia aged 29. If you have ruined yourself for me as seems highly probable why will you blame me if I ruin myself for my daughter? Of what use will any sum or provision be to her if she is allowed, by the neglect of others calling itself prudence, to fall into the abyss of insanity? It is useless to blame the doctors either. I hate writing these letters. That is why I gave it up almost in despair. But since I have to pay these doctors somebody has to write it. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
