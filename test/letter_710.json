  "text": "Dear Mr Pinker: Allow me in the first place to offer you my condolence on the sudden death of your father. I would have done so before but I did not know that the agency was still in existence until I heard casually shortly before receipt of your letter that it was being carried on by his son. As regards the question in your letter I cannot consent to any alteration of the text of Ulysses. I shall feel obliged if you can give me any information concerning the theatrical manager whose name is mentioned on the enclosed slip. I expect to be in London in a week or ten days and shall call on you if I stay there, as is probable, for a few days. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
