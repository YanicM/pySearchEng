  "text": "Dear Mr Lennon, I am moving from this address on the 10-th prox. qnd hqve been so busy that I have not hqd time to reply to your kind letter. In the intervql between the first qnd second communication from Mr Fitz Gerald I sent on to General Dawes copies of Sullivan’s recent Genoese and Neapolitan notices with typed english translation. It so happens that the Russian American sculptor Davidson is doing his head and mine at the same time for s show in London in June. I cannot find General Dawes’s letter, either I sent it om to Sullivan and he has not returned it or he has returned it and I have packed it up in one of my numerous cases of books, anyhow his attitude was much more helpful than that of the British ambassador here or the Irish minister. He said he had written personnally to Insul forwarding him the papers and asking him to investigate qnd if possible take up Sullivan’s case. Of course if more pressure can be broughtt to bear through Mr Vincent so much the better. My warm thanks for all the trouble you have taken, Sincerely yours James Joyce",
