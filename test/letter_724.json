  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks for the cheque (250£) and I am glad you took advantage of the rise in the pound which today stands at 67. I have also received the press-cuttings which might be called ‘Noise about Joyce’. I do not think that Mr Noyes has read the book but you can take a few sentences from his article in the Sunday Chronicle to add to the press extracts. I think copies of it and the Evening Standard ought to be sent to Mr Larbaud (who probably knows Mr Noyes’s writings), Mr Jaloux and Mr Pound. For a reason which I will explain to you later I should prefer that you and not I wrote first to Mr Marcel Rey, sending him a copy of Exiles and the inevitable press extracts. I do not think that you ought to keep any copies of the book at your office. I imagine they cannot search your house without a warrant unless with the aid of Miss Marsden’s patron saint. That solitary detective is an interesting figure. Is he what the English call a King Beaver, that is an Irish constabularyman with red whiskers, riding a red bicycle? I shall write you tomorrow or next day about my monotonous eye and my thirtyfifth doctor. I shall see that my daughter puts the number of your house on the envelope. She is more absentminded than ever since she met the King of Spain.",
