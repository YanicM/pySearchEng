  "text": "Dear Pound: Your letter was delayed in transit. I have now rung up Mrs Dyer (whom I know personally) but find she is in London and is not expected back till the middle of next week. I shall ring her up again on Wednesday or Thursday next and let you know. Thanks for kind messages. I hope Mrs Pound, yourself and the boy are all well. We are, I hope. Lucia has been ill but is now much better, I am glad to say. As a matter of fact I thought of going your way a few months ago when, being in Zurich and wishing to go to the coast, I found that Genoa (to my surprise) was only 9 hours away That is a fine likeness of you in the corner of your notepaper. Tante belle cose da noi tutti Una stretta di mano James Joyce",
