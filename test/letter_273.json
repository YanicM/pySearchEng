  "text": "My darling Nora I have just wired you the beautiful motive from the last act of the opera you like so much Werther: ‘Nel lieto dì pensa a me’. And as it was too late to wire you money I paid £1 to my partner here Rebez and got him to wire to Caris in Trieste to pay Signora Joyce immediately 24 crowns. I hope you will have a merry Xmas, darling. Now, dearest, I expect Stannie will wire me all he can for the 1st so that I can start. Darling, I am in a most dreadful state of excitement at present. All day I have been in the middle of the bustling Xmas crowd down at the cinematograph. There was a young constable there on special duty. When it was over I took him upstairs to give him a drink and found he was from Galway and his sisters were at the Presentation Convent with you. He was amazed to hear where Nora Barnacle had ended. He said he remembered you in Galway, a handsome girl with curls and a proud walk. My God, Nora, how I suffered! Yet I could not stop talking to him. He seems a fine courteous-mannered young man. I wondered did my darling, my love, my dearest, my queen ever turn her young eyes towards him. I had to speak to him because he came from Galway but O how I suffered, darling. I am dreadfully excited. I don’t know what I am writing. Nora, I want to go back to you. Forget everybody but me, darling. I am sure there are finer fellows in Galway than your poor lover but 0, darling, one day you will see that I will be something in my country. How excited and restless I feel! I enclose his sister’s names. I saw that he was astonished at how you had ended. But, O God, would I not give you all the Kingdoms of this world if I only could. O, darling, I am so jealous of the past and yet I bite my nails with excitement whenever I see anybody from the strange dying western city in which my love, my beautiful wild flower of the hedges, passed her young laughing girlish years. Nora dearest, why are you not here to comfort me? I must end this letter I am so dreadfully excited. You love me, do you not, my dearest bride? O, how you have twisted me round your heart! Be happy, my love! My little mother, take me into the dark sanctuary of your womb. Shelter me, dear, from harm! I am too childish and impulsive to live alone. Help me, dear, pray for me! Love me! Think of me! I am so helpless tonight, helpless, helpless! Jim A million kisses to my darling dew-laden western flower, a million million kisses to my dear Nora of the curls. Jim Your mother sent that present and I wrote to thank her.",
