  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: We fled across the channel safely about twenty minutes before a storm. Neptune, hearing I had reached the seacoast, sent out a storm posthaste and my miserable holiday ended in Boulogne where we put up for the night in a gale and downpour. On arriving in Paris we could not find rooms in any hotel of the quarter so I had to come back here. The painters are still knocking on my wall and wrangling and the dog howling under my window. Dr Borschis away and I cannot see him till next week. I shall have to take my meals in some other quarter as both yesterday and the day before persons have come over to me after long scrutiny and asked if I am the great etc etc who wrote the etc etc and requested the pleasure of shaking my hand—an art for which I have very little talent. In spite of the letter you enclose I believe from what I could see with 13/30 of normal eyesight (⅓ + 3/10) that there has been trouble here. The version which Mr Rodker gave Miss Beach of this new edition is not that which you gave me. There is no arrangement with Mr André Germain. No corrections whatever of the text are to be made. The scale of expenses and profits seems to be quite different. Miss Beach is rather bewildered by the words ‘Paris agent’ as she understood that that was Mr Rodker’s position. I suppose some of this misunderstanding (inevitable whenever I am the provocative cause) will be cleared up but I should be glad to know as soon as possible whether the few corrections which we agreed to make of hideous blunders are being made. Perhaps a short note, similar to that in the first edition, could be inserted. I am writing this with one eye shut. There seems to be a very very slight improvement in the vision of the left eye. Perhaps it is only an illusion of mine. As soon as I see Dr Borsch I will let you know. Would it be too much trouble for you to call some day at my hotel and ask whether the bureau as they call it sent on any letters or papers? Nothing arrived here though I left them my address 12 rue de l’Odéon not knowing where I should stay. Some mail must have come. The chase being now open my wife and son are out flat-hunting while I, no knobs being available, count the stripes of the wallpaper.",
