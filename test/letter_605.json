  "text": "Dear Stannie: A few lines in haste. The Bank of England dividend warrants relative to the additional £2000, forwarded by you, have arrived. Besides this, however, Miss Weaver sent me a week ago through her solicitors an extra gift of £200 in the form of a cheque ‘thinking it may be useful at present’. Exiles is translated and accepted by the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre. It will be produced by Lugné Poe and Suzanne Desprès in December. Please give or send enclosed 100 lire to Silvestri—if he is in Trieste—and get from him the lightning sketch he made of me. I shall send him more later. Keep it⁠[,] also unframed sketch of his daughter in your room till my return or somewhere where the mice won’t eat the paint off. The whoreson Adriatica managed to deliver my case of books here last night. There was no difficulty on the part of the French douane. Some of Dubliners translated will appear in a Swiss review: and I suppose the Portrait is finished by now. Don’t put the door number after the house number when writing here. It bothers the Paris postman who is obliging but not over bright. Qu’est ce que c’est ce petit machin-là? Jim P.S. Silvestri—Androna del Porto, 4 (?)",
