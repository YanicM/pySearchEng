  "text": "Dear Budgen: I leave this address in a few days. Write to me pro tem, c/o Shakespeare & Co rue Dupuytren, 8, Paris VI The position would be in the Cunard or Ellerman line. Get into touch at once with Wyndham Lewis whom I saw off last night. He knows Lady Cunard who did also a lot for me. Then Robert McAlmon, an American poet and admirer of Ulysses, is a son-in-law of Sir John Ellerman. He went off with Lewis and they will do all they can. Don’t lose time. Had several uproarious allnight sittings (and dancings) with Lewis as he will perhaps tell you. I like him. Giorgio leaves with Hummel and Magli for Zurich on Friday for a month. O this moving job! Merda! J.J. Lewis’s address, I think, is 2 Alma Studios Stratford Road, London, W.8.",
