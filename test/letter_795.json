  "text": "Dear Miss Bollach: Do you think you could manage to type these verses (the first I have written for six years) and leave six copies with your concierge by tomorrow (Thursday) evening? I should be much obliged to you if you could. Also I should like to know how much I owe you and must apologise for not having settled with you before now. I should be very glad if we could meet some evening as, unfortunately, I am going to make another trip (into a hospital) and I wanted to arrange another matter with you before I do so. Are you free on Friday evening at 6.30 p.m. at the usual place? I shall feel glad if you will let me know. With many thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
