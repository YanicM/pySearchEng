  "text": "Dear Mr Quinn: I received in due course your cabled remittance, advance of purchase money for MS of my book Ulysses, and now your letter confirming dispatch of same. I thank you for your prompt reply to my cable. The Nausikaa episode was sent off some time ago and I am working at the Oxen of the Sun. There remains to be written Circe of the adventures. The close of the book or Nostos proper is, like the Telemachia, in three parts, but simpler, and is in part written. In favourable circumstances, I hope the book will be ready for publication in late autumn, that is, if my agent draws up a contract now, if the terms are satisfactory, and if Mr Huebsch gets the first half in June. There must be no alterations whatsoever of my text, either that already consigned in typescript (the version in The Little Review is, of course, mutilated) or that added on proofs; and, in view of the six years’ unbroken labour which the book has cost me, I must have a first proof and a revise of the whole book. The Egoist will publish it in London and I hear that a printer has been found. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man has been translated into Swedish; and the Swedish rights of Ulysses are disposed of. Exiles (already translated into German and produced) will appear in an Italian translation next week in Milan, the translator being Mr Carlo Linati, who translated Synge and Yeats. I am sorry to hear that you have been so dangerously ill and hope that you are now definitely well again. I have not a very pleasant existence at present for this city is overcrowded and we are packed into one flat with seven other people. If you should see Colum I beg you to give him my regards. He acted in a most friendly way during the trouble in Zurich and I am grateful to him for it and also to his friends Mr Watson and Mr Thayer. I should be glad to hear whether any publicity has been given to my statement concerning Mr Consul Bennett and the then British Minister in Berne, Sir Horace Rumbold, and their joint efforts. The company gave nearly fifty public performances in all parts of Switzerland in spite of their opposition. No person in England would take the matter up, as was only to be expected. I am not surprised to hear that nothing has come of the projected production of Exiles in America. The Stage Society in London kept the typescript for three years, put it on their programme, withdrew it (owing to a veto of Mr Shaw’s, as I am informed), then asked for it again and repeated the procedure. Some prolonged and fruitless negotiations took place also between my agent and the Abbey Theatre. Burnings, delays, deletions, translations which never appear (four people at different periods began translating my novel into French, but whether they got beyond the titlepage or not I never heard) and abortive productions make the material side of my literary life extremely tiresome. When I finish Ulysses, if I ever do, I shall probably rest completely for a year or two, for I certainly shall need a long rest. I shall write to Mr Huebsch tomorrow. I owe him a letter for some time past. With renewed thanks and sincere wishes for your permanent recovery James Joyce P.S. Please send all communications registered as the post here is very uncertain.",
