  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: I shall not allude to the sad subject of your letter except to say that perhaps it is enough that your sister’s improvement has not been completely undone by such a sudden shock as she had. I hope she will go on as before. A good friend of mine in Trieste, count Sordina (to whom with another Greek I owe my liberation from Austria) had practically the same kind of stroke and is now out and about. He must be about sixty, if not more. I set to work at once on your esteemed order and so hard indeed that I almost stupefied myself and stopped, reclining on a sofa and reading Gentlemen Prefer Blondes for three whole days. But this morning I started off afresh. I am putting the piece in the place of honour, namely the first pages of the book. Will try to deliver same punctual by Xmas. But cd send sample, viz. page 1, if customer so desires. The book really has no beginning or end. (Trade secret, registered at Stationers Hall.) It ends in the middle of a sentence and begins in the middle of the same sentence. Your piece is the prelude to the Contact piece which is continued by the MS you have, the Criterion, This Quarter and Navire d’Argent where the first part of the book ends. The third part you have also Yabcd. I have written only a small part of the second, ending with Roderick O’C. The fourth will be shorter than the others. The news is. Ernest Walsh died of consumption. Antheil had bad double pneumonia but got over it and is gone to Chamonix. Roth issues a monthly in which he prints a garbled Ulysses. He sells, I am informed, over 40,000 copies a month and has already published one third of the whole work. We cabled to John Quinn’s successor to enjoin him. After ten days he cabled, declining to take up the case. We are trying to stop the publication by means of friends in the Attorney General’s office on other grounds. I gave Yabcd to Mr Galantiére to sell in the U.S.A. The Rheinverlag want to rush out next month with a translation of which I have verified 88 pages. They decline to let the translator come here. I informed them that the German literary press would be circularised with a disclaimer if they did. Now am waiting. Pound has gone to Rapallo and wants to bring out a review. He asked me to send him Yabcd to read. His child is here at nurse. I sent you some papers which you can perhaps send on for the files afterwards. It is a long time or seems so since I wrote to this address. You may perhaps see me disguised as an Italian organist grinding out the prosepoem under your window maugre the prohibition on the corner. P.S. Re sample vide above. Reply will oblige respeakfolly yours M.M. Inkpen & Paperasses (Writers to the Signet)",
