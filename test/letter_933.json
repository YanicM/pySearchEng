  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: Many thanks. The cheque has arrived and I had written to MacLeish already on Saturday to have the proceeds of sale sent to Monro, Saw and Co. News here goes from bad to worse. Wallace died on Tuesday and was buried on Thursday…. As for Roth he now issues an appeal to the American public to subscribe to a Samuel Roth defence fund in the name of the liberty of beauty, and to fight his case. I am described as a renegade jew with an ‘organisation and vast funds’ behind him. I initialled your copy of the verses as I thought a full signature in such [a] poor effort would look too ridiculous. The form is pleasing. I am dejected enough by all these troubles…. That clergyman’s name is Rev. James Cropper. Ireland’s Eye (ey = island in Danish) is an islet off Howth Head. Phoenix Park is rather close but it is a place not built by hands—at least not all—whereas X is. I have been checking proof after proof and am tired. The dinner I had arranged for at Miss Beach’s between J.J. and S. is of course off for the present. The footnote about him in the book I send confirms my statement. Lalou’s remark about my new work is in a very small minority indeed.– Do you remember was it you or I who sent to Mr Aldington the dossier of the English Players. I should like to have it back but he has not answered me. With kindest regards and thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
