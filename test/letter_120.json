  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards: I am glad that you are pleased with Dubliners. As for the terms you offer me I may say that perhaps it would be best for me to put myself in your hands. I am sure that you will deal with me as generously as you can. As a matter of fact my future work in which you seem to be interested is largely dependent on an improvement of my financial state. I have written nearly a thousand pages of a novel but I have little leisure, comfort or prospects for continuing it. I should like to know when you propose to publish the book, in what form and at what price. If you will let me know I can send you the last story I have writtenâ€”unless perhaps you have as superstitious an objection to the number thirteen as you seem to have with regard to Ireland and short stories in general. Via Giovanni Boccaccio, 1, Trieste.",
