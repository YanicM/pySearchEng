  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver: These few lines are to show you how the protest is going. Shaw, Yeats, Moore, Pound and James Stephens refuse to sign. Tant pis! It is impossible to get a reply from Lewis (who was so anxious to have something of mine in his new review) so I have sent the piece to New York to try to get American copyright. I am plunged again in work. I want to try to finish Part I before 2 February or very soon after and, if possible, get away for some weeks. I cannot work at Part 3 in this way. It is too much. I must take it easier. Nobody else does it or a tithe of it. I feel greatly honoured by Einstein’s signature, given so quickly and simply. The lawcase in my name is proceeding in New York. My eyes are about the same perhaps a wee bit better. Dr Borsch was made officier de la légion d’honneur yesterday. With kindest regards sincerely yours James Joyce",
