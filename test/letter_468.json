I left reviews with one act plays by Lord Dunsany and covers for typescript for you with Miss Sauermann. If there is anything interesting in Mr Moore’s interview in Fortnightly will you let me know. My wife says every morning: I must write to Mrs Sykes. So she will—before Christmas. Kindest regards from us all and hopes that your hungry messmate has not choked himself yet. James Joyce",
