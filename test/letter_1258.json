  "text": "Dear Budgen: Please let us know by return are the names of the boxers ‘Jack Sharkey and Jimmy Wilde’ mentioned toward the end of the fragment correct. By the way please send back that proof and do not show it. Excuse my rather unsociable mood. It is a dreadful strain. A few days ago for example we had 3 express letters and 1 telegram. Curran apparently got scared. O la la! My wife thanks for your letter. Sorry you had such a bad time going over. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
