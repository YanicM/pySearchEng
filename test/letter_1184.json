  "text": "Dear Budgen: Best wishes for ’34. Fix up with U.S. as quickly as possible and let them go ahead, irrespective of Boots Ltd. This will wake your own people up. Since things are going on between Soupault and you I prefer not to intervene. We had dinner a week ago and I am well enough, shall meet at a New Year’s Eve party. Grippe ever since 7 Dec and then had larynx tracheite. Better today. What a year! Fog, illness, disaster, madness. Do not rely too much on G.G. as principal article. If he is on the loose he will have to write for his English masters. As for the piracy rumours you pass on my N.Y. publisher is quite prepared on that score. Sending your papers. Again happy ’34 to Mrs Budgen yourself and Sargent J.J.",
