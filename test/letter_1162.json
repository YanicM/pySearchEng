  "text": "Dear Colum: This is to thank you for your part of the Joyce Book. Gillet to whom I showed it liked your preface. I am writing under difficulties on the mantelpiece. Very little ink. No envelopes. Thanks for your wire on the 2nd. I am sorry Mrs Colum caught the grippe but am glad she is over it. As regards the alphabet I proposed to Burns and Oates 3 months ago that they should use these letters for a reprint of Chaucer poem A.B.C. (an ottava rima prayer to the Madonna) and offered them (on the sly) £100 guarantee. No reply. As regards Pomes Penyeach with Lucia’s lettrines of all my rich admirers in all the world only 2 bought and paid for copies—Miss Weaver (once rich) and Brauchbar of Zurich…. I sent Lucia 1000 frs through Kahane. I am also going to buy 3 copies and present them to Prof. Vogt’s daughter, the Bibliothèque Nationale and British Museum Library. I previously bought another which I presented to the director of the Oxford University Press. On hearing of Moore’s death I telephoned to London and sent a large wreath of palms. Not only was all mention of this absent from the list handed to the press but no member of the family thought it fit within a month to acknowledge receipt of it. I wrote to Magee about it and then had a letter from G.M.’s executor, saying that he was not responsible, that he gave express instructions about my wreath and that he could not understand why it had not been mentioned in the papers with the others or why the family etc. He agreed with me that the absence of G.M.’s colleagues and friends was unaccountable. Only one man of letters, Garnett, and none of his other colleagues was either present or represented and, of course, nobody from beyond S. Patrick’s Canal or, should I say, Canaille.",
