  "text": "Dear Stannie I expect you have my letter this morning and hope you will answer it by return of post. I have no idea how we are to finish the month unless you can help me. What you send I will pay you back punctually on the first as then, besides my pay, I will have 40 lire, 20 from my old pupil and 20 from a new one who is to begin then. I went to the Dusk of the Gods. Beside me in the gallery was an elderly man who smelt of garlic. He said it was a colossal opera and that it required great voices. He had heard it in Hamburg. He spoke a few words to me in English, such as, very cold, very good and beautiful. Before me was another man who said Wagner’s music was splendid but intended only for Germans. It was all intellect: no heart. Every time the horn motive sounded my garlicy friend twisted to me and said confidently: Adesso viene Sigfrido. He yawned much during the third act and went away before the last scene. When Brunnhilde brought on the horse, the latter, being unable to sing, evacuated: whereat the funny Italian disyllable flew from end to end of the gallery. There were many spectators who followed the opera with scores and librettos. On the stairs coming away and in the street I heard many people hum correctly and incorrectly the nine notes of the funeral motive. Nothing in the opera moved me. I have heard the funeral march often before. Only when Siegfried dies I responded from the crown of my head to his cry ‘O sposa sacra.’ I suppose there are a few men from time to time who really feel an impulse towards Gawd. [Unsigned]",
