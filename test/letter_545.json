  "text": "Dear Signor Linati: I don’t know how to thank you for your kindness. You will find in the current number of the English publication Who’s Who some details about myself. I enclose anyway one of the printed proofs already corrected in 1916. I have lived here at Trieste from 1904 onwards. In 1914 the Austrian Government allowed me to move with my family to Switzerland (Zurich), where I remained till a little while ago. I suffered a good deal with my eyes at Zurich and underwent a grave operation, iridotomy. In 1916 1 received a gift from the Crown for literary merits, on the recommendation of the then Prime Minister, Mr Asquith. As for Italian, I began to study it when I was 9 years old. I was then in a Jesuit college. Later I took a degree in Romance languages. The story of my books is very strange. For the publication of Dubliners I had to struggle for ten years. The whole first edition of 1000 copies was burnt at Dublin by fraud; some say it was the doing of priests, some of enemies, others of the then Viceroy or his consort, Countess Aberdeen. Altogether it is a mystery. The story is told in a little manifesto, which is now in the possession of Dr S.O. Steinberg, c/o the Zürcher Post, Peterstrasse, Zurich. If you send him a card in my name, I am sure he will send it you. If you cannot write German, you can write to him just as well in Italian, as he speaks Italian quite well. As for the Portrait, it was refused by nearly all the publishers in London. Moreover, when the courageous review The Egoist decided to publish it, not one printing works in the whole United Kingdom could be found to consent to print it. It was printed in America. The sheets were sent to London and bound there. My new book Ulysses was to appear in the Egoist of London. The same old story. From the very beginning the printers refused again. It appeared in fragments in the New York Little Review. Several times it was taken out of circulation through the post, by the action of the American Government. Now legal action is being taken against it. Exiles raised a kind of storm at Monaco. My agent at Berlin writes to me that for the moment nothing can be done, that it would be better to wait for public opinion to quieten down. I hope all the same to get it put on in Italy. You could give it a push with the latest story. In England it is not even spoken of. It was put in the programme of the Stage Society together with Congreve’s Way of the World, and d’Annunzio’s Dead City (translation by Arthur Symons) but then removed again, owing to a protest by Bernard Shaw, who found it ‘obscene’. I would very much like to read your books. I searched for and ordered them in vain in Zurich. They would interest me particularly as I am a personal friend of Yeats and knew Synge in Paris. Although, as you observe, my work enters in the infamy of the movement founded and conducted by them.",
