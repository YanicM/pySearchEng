  "text": "Dear Miss Weaver I thank you for the copy of The Egoist which reached me safely. As it seems very difficult to persuade London publishers to bring out my novel which appeared in your paper my agent, Mr Pinker, intends to try some firms in Paris: Mercure de France or Mr Conard. Possibly the Paris correspondent of your paper, Mrs Ciolkovska, may be able and willing to help me in this matter: I mean in bringing the book under the notice of one of these firms. I think I received some letters from her or through her when I was still in Austria but am not sure. I shall write if you will be so kind as to give me her address. With many thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
