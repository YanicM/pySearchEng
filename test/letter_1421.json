  "text": "Dear Eliot: Thanks for Curtius’s letter. May I ask you to do something for me! Is there another copy of my edition de luxe, unnumbered, available for me? If not may I have a numbered copy? I want to have it by May 4 so am sending this by air mail. Whatever amount may have to be paid I shall remit to the firm by cheque directly. The book and letters should be sent to me direct not to Léon. In fact, the copy is for him. The other copies all reached me safely. I also received the six copies of the ordinary American edition. With them came a copy of the Viking Press advertisement of the book in their catalogue. It informs the American public that ‘the scene of the book is laid in Dublin and Paris’. It will be a disappointment to many that they did not add ‘the Riviera and St Moritz’. With friendly greetings and thanks in advance.",
