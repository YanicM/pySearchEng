  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards Thanks for your letter of 12 instant with enclosure of Mr Bagnold, the delay of which I regret. I have however now replied to it. The misconception, I think, is not on my side. The agreement is dated 20 March 1914. The serial rights of my novel were ceded and the MS delivered in January of that year. The clause you allude to concerns serial publication of Dubliners. Moreover, I am not clear as to your position with regard to serial rights of work written by me since date of publication of Dubliners. I understand that you are entitled to a refusal of book rights. I do not care very much whether my novel appears serially elsewhere or not—now that it has been once serially published. In any case as I wish to get it out of my way I shall be very glad to hear from you definitely on the matter as soon as possible. The American edition of Dubliners, I presume, has been pirated since you did not arrange for it. I suppose there is no objection to my giving to Mr Pinker the disposal of the dramatic rights of a play, written by me, entitled Exiles, on condition that the rights of publication are yours if you wish to publish it. I should be very glad if you will kindly look through the press notices you have and see whether there is one of the Freeman’s Journal or of Sinn Fein, Dublin. I did not see them among those you sent me. Possibly they were omitted by mistake. Perhaps you are now in a position to send me an account of sales of Dubliners. I hope you received safely my list of corrections of misprints, sent some time ago. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
