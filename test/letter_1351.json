  "text": "Dear David: If your mother has had more quieting news from New York and if you can find an evening hour in this blistering heat cooled oil by imber serotinus I should be much obliged if you could do me a favour. I have sent you registered a book you certainly will have read as a young boy, probably more than once. I need to know something about it. I never read it and have nobody to read it to me and it takes too much time with all I am doing. Could you perhaps refresh your memory by a hasty glance through and then dictate to your mother (who, I hope, will buy me a bunch of new ribbons to spry up—her typewriter) an account of the plot in general as if it were a new book the tale of which you had to narrate in a book review. After that I should like you to mark with blue pencil in the margin the most important passages of the plot itself and in red pencil here and there wherever the words or dialogue seem to call for the special attention of a European. Don’t care about spoiling the book. It is a cheap edition. If you can then return it to me soon I shall try to use whatever bears upon what I am doing. Many thanks in advance but if for any reason you cannot do this it will be no great loss. The heat is abominable. I hope you all, especially Stevie, keep out of the sight of that monotonous old gasometer, the sun. Sincerely yours James Joyce",
