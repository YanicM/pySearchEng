  "text": "Dear Helen: Thanks for your long letter. Why you give me grammatick lessons. He was me friend Le Hon send you that wire. Le Hon very nice chap but he not know the Englisch grammatick like me and you, missus. Also why for you make me big speechstuff about Frankee Doodles? ‘Pipe pas! But, say, you’s grown to be a swell orator, missus. I’ll tell the woyld you is. I got you both’s wire about the appeal ruling. Three cheers for me, says I to meself, says I. Answers to questions, put or not put. The Vail family has another daughter. The Gilberts are not here. They are lying in wait outside Paris for a cheap excursion train which would bring them here about the 16 to 20 inst. Jean Wright is her correct maiden name. Gillet’s son-in-law died of cancer of the marrow on the first anniversary of his marriage. The Sullivans have rented an empty flat in the rue Juliette Lambert. I paid over to a solicitor (Mrs Jolas’s) the money I was able to collect including Mrs Bailly’s who paid like a goodhearted person, I think, so that ends that. I paid in yours too as it was no use bothering you. Don’t send me it. Time enough, when you come back to Paris. Lucia seems to have fallen for some undesirable gent in the Nyon shop who either lives in Dublin or London. They are being kept apart and he is going away. This has for the moment upset her. But they say it will soon pass. I see nothing crazy in that, as women go. Beckett has brought out his book More Pricks than Kicks. One of the characters is named Lucia but it is quite different. She is a cripple or something. Haven’t time to read it. But looked at it here and there before quitting Paris. He has talent, I think. Am glad to hear Stevie gets on well. The accounts of U.S.A. in the European press (heat and Dillinger etc) are so lurid that we are glad to know you are enjoying yourselves. You can write here even if we go on to Luxembourg, Cologne is only 14 hours away. Pity we dare not visit it. Moltissimi saluti Babbo",
