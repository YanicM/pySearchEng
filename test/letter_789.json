  "text": "Dear Miss Bollach: I am dreadfully late in acknowledging receipt of the second typescript which you rushed off for me so promptly. It was very kind of you indeed as it was a mere whim of mine to have it for that day. I apologise also for the delay in remitting you enclosed (frs 70.–) for your excellent work. The spelling ‘eygs’ is all right—a mixture of Danish and English which is intentional. My excuse for all my discourtesy is that I have been revising proof after proof of a passage which will appear next week in the transatlantic review—the piece about the four old men typed by you some months [ago]. So I hope you will forgive me. I shall of course send you a copy of the review immediately it comes out. I hope I may be able to see you this week as there is another small matter I want to bother you about. With renewed apologies and many thanks sincerely yours James Joyce",
