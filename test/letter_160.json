  "text": "Dear Mr Grant Richards, I have read through the letters which have passed between us with regard to my books and, as they date from over two years ago, I trust that this will be our last exchange of letters on the subject. First, as to my verses. Their publication has been three times postponed: first, on account of your going out of business, and of the consequent loss of the MS when I was in Pola, then, when you began business again and wrote to me in Trieste asking me to rewrite the MS and submit it to you once more, owing to my inability to accept your terms and pay part of the expenses of publication myself, and lastly, owing to the fact that, having then at your suggestion offered you my second book, you advised me to postpone the appearance of the verses until after its appearance. However, the apparent postponement, now, of my second book in favour of a half-written novel virtually postpones my book of verses for ever, and, as I have no wish that the verses should remain for ever in MS, I have thought well to accept a proposal which Mr Arthur Symons has made me with regard to their publication and therefore ask you kindly to send me back, by return of post, the MS of the verses. Now as to Dubliners. Having read through your letters carefully I perceive that I was in error on one point. I entered into the correspondence and in the end agreed to concede certain alterations solely in order that the 13th story Two Gallants might appear with the others. It seemed to me that you had some right to insist on its exclusion if I insisted that I would alter nothing of what I had written. I now perceive, however, that I sent you Two Gallants, together with yr copy of my signed agreement, on 23 Feb, that you acknowledged its receipt on 27 Feb, and that a week later on 6 March you sent me my copy of the agreement signed by Mr Grant Richards. From these dates I perceive that I had ‘delivered to the publisher the completed MS executed in a proper manner’ and that Two Gallants was part of the completed MS. When, under the impression that Two Gallants was not part of the completed MS I wrote to you, saying that, at least, you knew it was in preparation you replied on 19 June that you had no idea what it was about. Yet the MS of the story was in your possession on 27 Feb and not merely did you acknowledge its receipt then but you had the agreement signed and returned to me on 6 March and even wrote to me, a month later, asking me to send the 14th story as the book was going to the printer. It was only on the 23 April that you raised objections to Two Gallants and to passages in Counterparts and phrases in Grace, objections which later, owing to my having ingenuously drawn your attention to other parts of the book, were extended to include The Boarding-House, Ivy Day in the Committee-Room and An Encounter. You seem to think that I have harped too much upon the printer. But is he not the important person? You write to me early in February and say you have read the book yourself on behalf of the house and later on in the middle of May you tell me that your reader, Mr Filson Young, who also read it, agrees with you as to the impossibility of publishing it. It seems to me it would have been more logical for your reader to have pointed out to you that impossibility in January instead of agreeing with you in May, more logical and more considerate towards me. But really we all—you, your reader and I—are unimportant figures: the printer, alone, is important. His office, apparently, supersedes those of reader and publisher. The correspondence and agreement should have been signed by him, the book should have been read, printed and published by him—or by nobody. My part ends with the consignment of the MS: his part, if it begins at all, begins then and I am not sure that he is not entitled to act as deliverer, seller and reviewer of the book as well. Anyway he allows me my part of writing the book: this I have done and more. Scrupulous as he is, he cannot say as much for himself. But if I have harped too much on the printer it seems to me you have harped too much on the words ‘risk’ and ‘pocket’. The risk in your case, to judge from the clauses in the agreement, is not enormous. So far as I can see, a book which you and the other people you have shown it to admire so much, which you consider to be a chapter of the moral history of my country, ought to be able to achieve a sale of a few hundred copies among a population numbering some 47 millions of people, especially at a moment when that population and its parliament are about to be consulted as to the fate of the country of which my book treats. But, however this may be, (and it is your affair to consider it, not mine) once more I wish to assure you, since you raise the point again in your letter of 24 Sept, the appeal to my pocket is useless. I desire to have more leisure and more money and a different life and a different address in order that I may be able to work in my own fashion but, at the same time, I am enthusiastically thankful for my present position for, while I enjoy it modest though it be, I cannot plead the excuse of starvation or houselessness for a deliberate prostitution of my talent or a deliberate and hypocritical mutilation of my work. Finally as to my novel, and one word will be enough. I am not in a fit state of mind to complete it. For two years I have been living in hope and now that I see that those two years of waiting and hoping have availed me nothing it is really too much to expect that I should sit down calmly and continue to write and then to wait and hope again. For I am sure we would then have the same objections and the same letters. It is true that I stand in need of a publisher, but the publisher I need must be prepared to run some risk as otherwise it is difficult to see why he is entitled to any profit. It may be, however, that there are circumstances in your case which explain many of the enigmas in this correspondence and, in any case, I thank you for your kind appreciation both of the verses and of the stories. You say you are waiting to hear from me. The substance of what I have to say is this: if you can see your way to publish the MS at present in your possession with the changes I have made in deference to your objections you are at liberty to do so. That is to say, I will allow the inclusion of A Little Cloud about which there has been no difficulty, the fourteenth story, to balance the changes I made in the other stories in deference to your objections. I can make no more changes in it, and cannot put it aside in order to complete my novel. If, however, you cannot see your way to publish it, return it to me by return of post and, in any case, kindly return me the MS of the verses. Faithfully yours Jas A Joyce",
