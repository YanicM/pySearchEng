  "text": "Dear Mrs Colum: Thanks for your letter and am glad to hear you are both well. I wonder how are the Gormans. Never had a line from them since they left. Hope they are not ill. You have curiously misunderstood my letter. I am changing flat not city, so far as one can see, and of course Lucia is still in Ivry and I visit her every Sunday. Herewith is the picture and explanatory letter from the unknown painter. No, I did not receive any notice from the Yeats family. I do not know any member of the family. I met his very loquacious father once for a few minutes on Northumberland Road. There is no use now in going into the matter of the American publication of my book. So far it has been a hopeless bungle. As for the date every week we hear something different. The book, printed and bound, has been lying on my table for the past two months but the sheets for Mr Huebsch’s limited edition have not yet left England. It is a great bore having to move but we are lucky if we have not to move much farther and more hastily. I was invited to New York by the Pen Club for next May but wrote to them, thanking and declining. I hope you will both come over in the summer as you say. Let us know sometime ahead when and for how long. Kindest regards to you both sincerely yours James Joyce",
